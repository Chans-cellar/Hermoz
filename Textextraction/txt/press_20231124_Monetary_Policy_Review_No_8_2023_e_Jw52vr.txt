The Central Bank of Sri Lanka further reduce s policy interest rates  
 
The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 23 November  
2023, decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending 
Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 9.00 per cent and 10.00 
per cent, respectively. The Board arrived at this decision following a careful analysis of the current 
and expected developments  in the domestic and global economy , with the aim of achieving and 
maintaining inflation at  the targeted level of 5 per cent  over the medium term , while  enabl ing the 
economy to reach  and stabilise at the  potential  level. The Board took note of possible upside 
risks to inflation projections in the near term due to supply -side factors stemming from the 
expected developments domestic ally and global ly. However, the Board viewed that such near -
term risks would not materially change the medium -term inflation outlook, as inflation 
expectations of the public remain anchored and economic activity  is projected to remain below 
par in the near to medium term. Further, t he Board viewed that with this reduction of policy  
interest rates , along with the monetary policy  measures carried out  since June 2023 , sufficient 
monetary easing has been  effected  in order to stabilise inflation  over the medium term. Hence, 
the Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary 
easing measures to market interest rates , particularly lending rates,  by the financial institutions , 
thereby accelerat ing the normalisation of market interest rates  in the period ahead .  
Headline inflation continues to remain low, reflecting subdued demand conditions . Headline 
inflation, as measured by the year -on-year change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 
2021=100) , was recorded at 1.5 per cent in October 2023 , compared to  1.3 per cent in September 
2023. Food inflation continued to be negative ( year-on-year) for the fourth consecutive month in 
October 2023. The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2021=100) based headline inflation 
(year -on-year)  was recorded at 1.0 per cent in October 2023 , comp ared to 0.8 per cent in 
September 2023 . Both CCPI and NCPI based core inflation (year -on-year), which reflects 
underlying demand pressures in the economy, moderated further in October 2023, reflecting the 
subdued demand pressures in the economy. A one-off upward movement in inflation is expected 
in the near term, driven mainly by the changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed by the 
Economic Research Department  

 Government effective January 2024 . The spillover effects of tax measures and other 
developments are likely to be muted due to subdued underlying demand pressures ; hence, t his 
rise in inflation  is expected to be transitory . Accordingly, h eadline inflation  over the medium term 
is expected to converge towards the targeted level of 5 per cent , supported by appropriate policy 
measures.   
 
Note: A forecast is neither a promise nor a commitment.  
The projections reflect the available data, assumptions and judgements made at the forecast round  in November  2023. They 
are conditional on the forecasts of global energy and food prices; gradual growth recovery of Sri Lanka’s major trading partn ers; 
the anticipated domestic fiscal path in line with the IMF -EFF projections  under the debt restructuring scenario  and key changes 
proposed in the Government Budget Speech – 2024 ; and global financial conditions implied by the monetary policy stance of 
the USA. Further, the proje ctions are conditional on the model -consistent interest rate path and the resulting macroeconomic 
responses. Any notable change in these assumptions could lead to the realised inflation path deviating from the projected pat h. 
Given the prevailing domestic and global economic uncertainties, adverse weather conditions and geopolitical tensions, the 
risks associated with the current projections are higher than in normal times. These risks arise due to the possibility of va rious 
factors deviating from the levels already internalised in projections, either explicitly or implicitly. In particular, there ar e upside 
risks to inflation projections stemming from factors such as the possibility of increased taxes and related second -round i mpacts, 
possible wage hikes, large increases in  energy prices, any larger than expected exchange rate depreciation amidst relaxed 
import restrictions, the impact of possible adverse weather on agricultural production and in turn on food inflation, etc.  
Meanwhile, downside risks to inflation projections include the possibility of a faster recovery of supply conditions and the 
sustained impact of diminished purchasing power of the public.  
The Central Bank remains committed to communicating any changes to the inflation outlook to the public on a regular basis, 
enabling the public to make informed decisions.

The fan chart illustrates the uncertainty surrounding the baseline projection path using confidence bands of gradually fading  
colours. The confidence intervals (CI) shown on the chart indicate the ranges of values within which inflation may fluctuate 
over the medium term. For example, the thick green shaded area represents the 50 per cent confidence interval, implying 
that there is a 50 per cent probability that the actual inflation outcome will be within this interval. The confidence bands 
show the increas ing uncertainty in forecasting inflation over a longer horizon.

 Market interest rates are expected to normalise in the period ahead . Market interest rates 
continued to adjust downwards,  and most benchmark interest rates have declined significantly . 
Meanwhile, the y ields on government securities are also adjusting downwards with falling risk 
premia . The reduction of policy interest rates by 100 bps in this monetary policy review is 
expected to create  further  space for market interest rates  to adjust downward  and normalise in 
the period ahead . Reflecting the transmission of the relaxed monetary policy stance , outstanding 
credit to the private sector by the banking sector expanded on a month ly basis in September  as 
well as in October 2023  based on provisional data . With  the moderation  of market lending interest 
rates, credit to the private sector is expected to increase further  in the period ahead , thereby 
supporting the envisaged rebound of domestic economic activity.  
 
Policy interest rates are further reduced in view of the stable inflation outlook over the 
medium term and subdued demand pressures  
In consideration of the current and expected macroeconomic developments highlighted above, 
the Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 23 November 
2023, decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending 
Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 bps to 9.00 per cent and 10.00 per cent, 
respectively. The Board viewed that, with this reduction of policy interest rates  and based on the 
available information , further monetary policy easing will be paused  in the near term , given the 
space for market interest rates to adjust downwards in line with the current and past monetary 
policy easing measures . The Board anticipates a swift , sizeable and broad -based reduction in 
overall market lending interest rates in line with the monetary policy easing measures effected 
since June 2023 . Such adjustment in interest rates is imperativ e to ease the domestic monetary 
conditions  further . The Board stressed the need for all licensed banks  to take swift measures to 
reduce market lending interest rates to ensure that the benefit s of the series of monetary policy 
easing measures are adequately passed on to businesses and households.  
 
The Monetary Policy Board will continue to assess risks to inflation  projections , among others, 
and stand ready to take appropriate measures to maintain domestic price stability in the period 
ahead while supporting the economy to reach its potential.

(b) With the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers at its meeting held on 30 January 2023, the outstanding foreign currency guaran teed debt of the Ceylon 
Petroleum Corporation (CPC) was absorbed into central government debt with effect from December 2022, in li ne with the actions agreed under the IMF -
EFF arrangement to restructure the balance sheets of selected State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs). Accordingly, a part o f this adjustment was 
effected in April 2023, hence, was reflected in the balance sheet of  the particular state -owned commercial bank, which caused a reduction in credit to 
public corporations/ SOBEs and an expansion in net credit to the government (NCG).
