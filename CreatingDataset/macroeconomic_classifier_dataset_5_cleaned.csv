1Introduction
The Sri Lankan economy has been experiencing 
frequent incidences of vulnerabilities and instability 
conditions instilled by structural macroeconomic problems coupled with global and domestic shocks.",Unclassified
"The conditions weakened drastically since 2020 with 
the onset of the pandemic, along with ad-hoc policy 
changes that exacerbated stresses in the economy.",Unclassified
"The 
programme aims at restoring macroeconomic stability at 
large.",Unclassified
"•	Legislative changes for enhanced governance 
and accountability framework: New pieces of legislation, such as the proposed Central Bank Act, Banking Act, and other revisions to existing 
legislations are expected to strengthen the 
institutional and regulatory framework relating to the economic management of the country.",Unclassified
"A new anti-corruption law is to be introduced harmonising the United Nations Convention against Corruption, 
the first such law in South Asia, providing for 
the creation of an independent Anti-Corruption Commission.",Unclassified
"A new Public Financial Management (PFM) law will be enacted to streamline the budget 
formulation process and to enhance accountability 
mechanism in public finance.",Unclassified
"•	Reforming social safety nets: Despite an increase in social safety nets related spending and beneficiaries in recent years, it has been identified that there is significant scope for improvement regarding the coverage and selection.",Unclassified
"Considering 
the issues prevailing in the existing social safety 
nets framework, the IMF-EFF arrangement has specified certain institutional reforms to improve efficiency, coverage, and targeting of social safety nets programmes.",Unclassified
"•	Restoring price stability:  The Central Bank is 
expected to restore price stability by driving inflation in a steady disinflation path to bring it back to the targeted range under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework through appropriate monetary policy actions.",Unclassified
"•	Strengthening financial institutions and financial system stability: The IMF is of the view that Sri Lanka’s financial system is heavily exposed to 
the public sector, moderately capitalised, and could 
face material capital and forex shortfalls following a debt restructuring.",Unclassified
"Consequently, there is a possibility that banks could face significant capital 
and forex shortfalls as a result of a sovereign debt 
restructuring.",Unclassified
"Therefore, plans are under way for the capital restoration of systemic banks following asset quality reviews to strengthen the resilience of 
the state owned banks.",Unclassified
"Meanwhile, financial sector 
supervision and the crisis management framework 
will be strengthened to make Sri Lanka’s financial 
system more robust.",Unclassified
"In addition to these specific benefits, the IMF supported programme would bring several positive spillovers to the economy through improved investor confidence, 
possible sovereign rating upgrades, and reopening 
of access to markets, among others.",Unclassified
"Considering the challenging nature of the targets set out, the authorities will have to put in a lot of effort and show 
commitment to ensuring the successful completion of the programme throughout the programme period.",Unclassified
"The severity of the current economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing the longstanding structural issues in a sustainable 
manner beyond the reforms agenda in the IMF 
programme through national policies which are formulated in consultation with stakeholders and free from political influences with vested interests.",Unclassified
"This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting 
the conditionalities attached to such programmes, 
especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements.",Unclassified

in significant losses in the share values of the US

institutions and the consequent contagion effects 
could become a source of significant downside risk

disinflation on account of an easing in labour market conditions in advanced economies, cooling 
wage inflation, and a sharp decline in the prices

"The strengthening of the Sri Lanka rupee, if persists, could also contribute to lower price pressures in the near term.",Unclassified

may need to be carefully managed as it could 
affect the general price level swiftly.",Unclassified

The Central Bank continues to be the key responsible 
apex financial institution for the regulation, licensing, registration, and supervision of financial institutions as well as the resolutions of financial institutions in order to ensure financial system stability.",Unclassified
"Moreover, the CBA 
attributes the macroprudential authority to the Central 
Bank, with the view to securing the stability of the financial system in line with the macroprudential policy.",Unclassified
