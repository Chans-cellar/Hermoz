 overviewthe sri lankan economy contracted by per cent in on year on year basis recording its highest contraction in the backdrop of the worst ever economic crisis experienced by the post independence economy while prudent policy intervention averted possible deepening of the crisis ,
the economic crisis initially caused supply disruptions in the forms of severe shortages of consumer goods energy sources including fuel and electricity and inputs for various industries mainly on account of the sharp depletion of foreign exchange liquidity in the market leading to significant increase in prices ,
this situation compelled both the central bank and government to introduce painful but essential policy measures such as unprecedented adjustments to policy interest rates to curtail inflationary pressures and prioritisation of essential imports to minimise foreign exchange outflows to prevent further worsening of the crisis ,
these measures contributed to contain demand pressures minimise supply side disruptions and improve availability of essential imports including fuel and material for industries thereby gradually stabilising the economy ,
reflecting the impact of economic stresses all three major economic activities namely industry services and agriculture contracted during the year ,
the setback in manufacturing construction and mining and quarrying activities led the contraction in industry activities while contractions observed particularly in real estate activities including ownership of dwellings insurance and financial services negatively affected services activities outpacing the positive spillovers of the recovery in tourist arrivals recorded on year on year basis ,
subdued performance in fishing activities caused by fuel shortages in animal production owing to shortages of animal feed and in growing of rice and vegetables driven by the lack of fertiliser dampened the overall growth in agriculture activities ,
this situation in turn resulted in decline in labour productivity despite the favourable developments in key labour market indicators ,
on the expenditure front both consumption and investment grew significantly at current prices induced by elevated price levels in ,
however at constant prices both investment and consumption contracted driven by the deterioration of purchasing power and holding up of investments under soaring inflation and high borrowing cost ,
on the other hand net external demand at current prices improved due to substantial growth in the export of goods and services benefitting from the sharp depreciation of the sri lanka rupee which surpassed the growth in the import of goods and services ,
the relatively slower growth in imports was largely result of dried up forex liquidity in the banking sector restrictions on non essential imports sharp depreciation of the rupee and the significant tightening of monetary policy ,
