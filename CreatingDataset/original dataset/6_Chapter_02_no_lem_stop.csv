 overviewthe sri lankan economy contracted by per cent in on year on year basis recording its highest contraction in the backdrop of the worst ever economic crisis experienced by the post independence economy while prudent policy intervention averted possible deepening of the crisis ,
the economic crisis initially caused supply disruptions in the forms of severe shortages of consumer goods energy sources including fuel and electricity and inputs for various industries mainly on account of the sharp depletion of foreign exchange liquidity in the market leading to significant increase in prices ,
this situation compelled both the central bank and government to introduce painful but essential policy measures such as unprecedented adjustments to policy interest rates to curtail inflationary pressures and prioritisation of essential imports to minimise foreign exchange outflows to prevent further worsening of the crisis ,
these measures contributed to contain demand pressures minimise supply side disruptions and improve availability of essential imports including fuel and material for industries thereby gradually stabilising the economy ,
reflecting the impact of economic stresses all three major economic activities namely industry services and agriculture contracted during the year ,
the setback in manufacturing construction and mining and quarrying activities led the contraction in industry activities while contractions observed particularly in real estate activities including ownership of dwellings insurance and financial services negatively affected services activities outpacing the positive spillovers of the recovery in tourist arrivals recorded on year on year basis ,
subdued performance in fishing activities caused by fuel shortages in animal production owing to shortages of animal feed and in growing of rice and vegetables driven by the lack of fertiliser dampened the overall growth in agriculture activities ,
this situation in turn resulted in decline in labour productivity despite the favourable developments in key labour market indicators ,
on the expenditure front both consumption and investment grew significantly at current prices induced by elevated price levels in ,
however at constant prices both investment and consumption contracted driven by the deterioration of purchasing power and holding up of investments under soaring inflation and high borrowing cost ,
on the other hand net external demand at current prices improved due to substantial growth in the export of goods and services benefitting from the sharp depreciation of the sri lanka rupee which surpassed the growth in the import of goods and services ,
the relatively slower growth in imports was largely result of dried up forex liquidity in the banking sector restrictions on non essential imports sharp depreciation of the rupee and the significant tightening of monetary policy ,

the gross national income gni estimated by adjusting gdp for the net primary income from the rest of the world also grew by per cent at current prices in compared to the growth of per cent recorded in ,
this growth in gni during the year merely reflects the increase in gdp at current prices as net primary income from the rest of the world deteriorated ,
gdp per capita increased to rs us dollars in compared to rs us dollars in ,
the increase in gdp per capita in rupee terms was driven by the significant increase in gdp at current prices while gdp per capita in us dollar terms declined due to the substantial depreciation of the sri lanka rupee against the us dollar during the year ,
meanwhile gni per capita was estimated at rs us dollars in compared to rs us dollars in contribution from institutional sectorsthe non financial corporations nfc sector representing per cent share was the largest contributor to the gross value added gva estimated at current market prices in ,

national output expenditure income and employmentintroductionnational accounts estimates are among the critical inputs in economic analyses as well as in policymaking as they reflect the real sector developments of an economy ,
therefore it is essential to accommodate the changes in the economic and price structures of an economy over time to the national accounts estimates through regular rebasing exercises ,
fulfilling this requirement the base year of sri lankan national accounts estimates has been revised from time to time to in history and the latest to ,
the department of census and statistics dcs as the official compiler updated the base year of national accounts estimates to replacing the previous base year of ,
alongside the latest rebasing exercise dcs expanded the production boundary and broadened the coverage of economic activities while some improvements were made to the compilation methodologies ,
expanding the production boundary and coverage of economic activitiesthe coverage of many economic activities was broadened during the latest rebasing exercise ,
one of the major coverage expansions is the inclusion of reclamation work relating to the colombo international financial city cifc project into the industry activities which were carried out during the period from to taking into account the percentage of work done in each year ,
this led to considerable fluctuations in the gross domestic product gdp estimates and the corresponding gdp growth rates during the period ,
the coverage of several agriculture and services activities was also broadened during this rebasing exercise ,
along with these coverage improvements the rebased gdp estimates related to the production approach were disseminated under economic activities instead of economic activities under the series ,
this is attributable to the estimation of plant propagation and agricultural supporting activities separately under the new base year ,
in terms of agriculture activities coverage improvements were introduced to the growing box rebasing of national accounts estimates to base year of fruits oil palm flower plant propagation household log production and agricultural supporting activities ,
in terms of services activities the coverage in the areas of information technology warehousing activities broadcasting activities courier services and financial services were broadened during this rebasing exercise ,
methodological improvements and use of new data sourcesduring the rebasing exercise several methodological improvements were adopted in estimating many economic activities such as agricultural supporting activities forestry and logging plant propagation of flower plants manufacturing construction electricity generation it programming consultancy accommodation services food and beverage service activities and wholesale and retail trade activities ,
further new data sources including economic census information technology and information technology enabled services survey and revenue information related to the registered companies of colombo stock exchange cse were incorporated in compiling the rebased estimates under the base year ,
moreover dcs adopted the double deflation method in place of the single deflation method in compiling the estimates for many economic activities at constant prices under the new base year ,
key outcomes of rebasing national accounts estimates to base year ,
the base year revision affected many economic indicators such as the size of the economy value of gdp gdp growth rate and share of major economic activities to the gdp ,
compared to the previous base year of the rebased gdp estimates at constant prices indicated level shift attributable to the ,
the central bank acknowledges the information and the constructive feedback provided by the dcs in preparing the extended version of this article published in the news survey volume number under the topic rebasing of national accounts estimates to base year ,
under the single deflation method both output and intermediate consumption ic are deflated using the same price index whereas in the double deflation method output and ic are deflated using two different price indices to compile constant price estimates accurately ,

 level shift at current prices source department of census and statistics,
central bank of sri lanka annual report replacement of base year prices with prices to capture the evolution in prices as well as the coverage and methodological improvements ,
consequently the corresponding gdp growth rates were affected by the base year revision ,
particularly the addition of reclamation work related to the cifc project led to considerable shift in gdp level as well as growth rates during the period which is reflected in the data presented in table and figure further along with the base year revision the contribution to gdp from its major components namely agriculture industry services and taxes less subsidies on products were changed especially with an increase in the share of industry activities and decline in the share of services activities and taxes less subsidies on products as shown in figure following the increase in the gdp estimates at current prices macroeconomic indicators which are expressed as percentage of gdp such as budget deficit and debt to gdp were also revised ,
generally rebasing process provides policymakers and other stakeholders with more representative set of economic statistics of the existing economic structure for better evidence based decision making ,
however when referring to the rebased gdp estimates it is imperative to understand the impact of one off events separately from the impact of long lasting events and evaluate them appropriately ,

the overall viap contracted by per cent year on year during compared to year on year growth of per cent in ,
most of the sub indices including paddy tea rubber and livestock and livestock products contributed to the overall decline whereas the fruits sub index recorded significant improvement along with the coconut sub index compared to the previous year ,
paddytotal paddy production of the country declined significantly in recording its lowest annual production since amidst severe supply side disruptions including the shortage of fertilisers ,

 from the volume index of agricultural production compiled by dcs replaced the agriculture production index api which was compiled by the central bank of sri lanka ,
on the importation of inorganic fertilisers and other agrochemicals in the latter part of the sequels of the ban compounded with the lack of foreign exchange to import required fertilisers resulted in acute fertiliser shortages in the country having significant bearing on the paddy sector among others ,
following the bumper harvest in annual paddy production recorded decline of per cent year on year to million metric tons in ,
this was combined outcome of per cent decline in the maha season which accounted for per cent of total production and per cent drop in the paddy harvest in the yala season ,
the net land extent harvested during the year marginally declined by per cent to hectares while the average yield of paddy declined to kilogrammes per hectare in compared to kilogrammes per hectare recorded in reflecting the impact of input shortages and productivity slowdown during these seasons ,
the total paddy production in was equivalent to million metric tons of rice and approximately months of sufficiency of household rice demand ,
in order to arrest the price pressures stemming from rice shortages in the domestic market and meet the overall rice requirement of the country while ensuring food security the government initiated measures to import rice during the year ,
accordingly around metric tons of rice were imported in compared to metric tons of rice imported during the previous year ,
nevertheless as domestically available rice stocks gradually increased along with imported stocks and the harvest from the yala season ban was imposed on the importation of rice except for few varieties with effect from december ,
elevated input costs combined with the drop in production resulted in higher paddy and rice prices during ,
continuing the trend the level of sufficiency is based on the average household rice consumption estimate in the household income and expenditure survey hies ,
however the actual rice demand of the country may be significantly higher than the hies average household rice consumption estimate as it excludes the rice demand for other sources such as restaurants and hotels rice based food industries etc ,

central bank of sri lanka annual report observed since late paddy prices recorded further increase during early largely driven by supply shortages stemming from the lower production in the maha season and increased demand resulting from market speculations about supply shortages in the market ,
the government intermittently intervened in the paddy and rice markets to reduce price volatility and maintain steady supply ,
accordingly the guaranteed purchasing prices for kilogramme of samba nadu and keeri samba paddy were increased to rs rs and rs respectively during the maha season pursuant to the paddy purchasing programme of the paddy marketing board pmb ,
pmb was able to purchase around metric tons of paddy from the maha season ,
further considering the escalation of cost of production in the paddy sector pmb increased the guaranteed purchase prices of kilogramme of samba nadu and keeri samba paddy to rs rs and rs respectively in the yala season ,
however pmb was able to purchase only around metric tons of paddy under the new guaranteed prices due to lack of funding available for pmb to purchase paddy thereby compelling farmers to sell their paddy stocks at low price to private millers causing moderation of paddy prices towards late ,
however the average prices of all varieties of paddy remained above the price levels observed in ,
the average price of samba paddy recorded notable increase of per cent year on year to rs per kilogramme from rs per kilogramme recorded in while the average price of nadu paddy also increased substantially to rs per kilogramme in from rs per kilogramme recorded in registering year on year increase of per cent over the previous year ,
following similar trends in paddy prices the prices of rice varieties also showed an upward trend throughout despite some moderation in late ,
accordingly the average retail prices of samba and nadu were at rs per kilogramme and rs per kilogramme respectively in compared to rs per kilogramme and rs per kilogramme respectively in ,
meanwhile several measures were undertaken by the government to stabilise retail rice prices in the market including the imposition of maximum retail price mrp for rice varieties and boosting supply through rice imports to address the excessive volatility in retail rice prices amidst shortfalls in the rice supply in the local market ,
accordingly mrps for nadu samba and keeri samba were imposed at rs per kilogramme rs per kilogramme and rs per kilogramme respectively effective table paddy sector statisticsitem unit b ,

to alleviate the impact of persistently high prices the government launched programme to purchase nadu paddy from farmers at rs per kilogramme during the maha season with the intention of distributing kilogrammes of rice per month to low income families in march and april ,
several measures were undertaken by the government in to address contemporary issues in the agriculture sector while striving to improve the long term productivity of the sector ,
with due consideration to the adverse effects of inadequate fertiliser availability emanating from the banning of importation of chemical fertilisers and agrochemicals as well as the limited liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market to facilitate fertiliser imports the government expedited measures to provide chemical fertilisers since the third quarter of ,
accordingly the government procured metric tons of urea under the indian line of credit for the yala cultivation while the distribution of urea to paddy farmers was made at subsidised price of rs per kilogramme sack of urea during the yala season ,
in addition several arrangements were made with international organisations including the world bank wb the asian development bank adb and the food and agriculture organisation fao through various assistance programmes and grants to ensure the timely supply of required urea triple super phosphate tsp and muriate of potash mop fertilisers for the maha season and for upcoming seasons ,
accordingly the government was able to disburse around metric tons of urea for paddy cultivation in maha season significantly contributing to the recovery of the paddy sector ,
further considering the need for allowing domestic use of glyphosate as weedicide the cabinet of ministers granted approval in september to import required quantities of glyphosate for agricultural purposes in the maha season for period of six months ,
in addition urgent measures were taken to address the nutrient deficiencies which led to the yellowing of paddy plants in certain districts during the maha season via provisioning of fertilisers and other organic supplements while expediting extension services for pest and disease management ,
in addition rice variety screening programmes to identify the best performing varieties continued throughout and four new varieties with special characteristics of short duration high yield and drought resistance were released in ,
of these four new varieties one was released for industrial purposes such as biscuit production ,
in an effort to improve precision agriculture through site specific weed management experiments were carried out in trial paddy fields to identify major weed types and the impact of those weed types on paddy fields using multispectral drone image technologies ,
teathe production of tea registered notable decline of per cent year on year in largely due to the lagged effect of acute shortages of fertilisers and agrochemicals domestically ,

accordingly production of high medium and low grown tea which contributed to around per cent per cent and per cent of the total production respectively declined by per cent per cent and per cent respectively in ,
meanwhile the average yield in the smallholder sector decreased to kilogrammes per hectare compared to kilogrammes per hectare reported in registering year on year decline of per cent in average yield ,
the tea sector experienced rise in production costs in due to the elevated prices of chemical fertilisers and other agricultural inputs coupled with domestic shortages of those inputs as well as the upward adjustments in utility prices including fuel electricity and water thereby hampering the country competitiveness in global tea markets ,
consequently the estimated cost of production of tea increased by rs to rs per kilogramme in compared to ,
tea prices at the colombo tea auction cta reached the historically highest level in and remained elevated throughout the year ,
the average price of tea increased notably by per cent to rs per kilogramme during the year from rs per kilogramme recorded in ,
accordingly the average tea prices for high medium and low grown tea reported year on year increase of per cent per cent and per cent respectively in ,
further the average price received by smallholders for green leaves also increased significantly to rs per kilogramme in compared to rs per kilogramme in ,
the average export price fob of tea increased by per cent to us dollars per kilogramme during compared to us dollars per kilogramme recorded in the preceding year ,
the increase in average tea prices during the year was partly attributed to the decline in the quantity supplied to the cta amidst the decline in local production while the depreciation of the sri lanka rupee also contributed to the price hike in rupee terms ,
in several measures were undertaken by the government aimed at enhancing the productivity value addition and competitiveness of the sri lanka tea industry ,
the sri lanka tea board sltb initiated concessionary loan scheme at an interest rate of per cent enabling tea factories to purchase fertiliser for their green tea leaves suppliers ,
during the year sltb disbursed rs million among tea factories under the factory modernisation subsidy scheme supporting modernisation activities of these factories aimed at improving the quality of the production process ,
in addition sltb granted rs million through the replantation subsidy programme to enhance the productivity of tea lands while subsidy of rs million was provided for the installation of irrigation sprinkler systems in acres of medium scale tea lands ,
several measures were undertaken by the tea small holdings development authority tshda in relation to tea replanting and new planting programmes and crop rehabilitation subsidy programmes ,
during the year hectares of tea lands were replanted and hectares of new lands were converted into tea lands while the process of infilling in tea lands was continued ,
throughout the year efforts towards enhancing awareness among tea smallholders were carried out through advisory services ,
tri continued its efforts in relation to research and development activities and service projects pursuant to its strategic plan ,
accordingly special projects such as the development and introduction of motorised selective tea harvester suitable for tea lands in the country establishment of seed gardens to increase the production of improved seeds as source of planting materials in drought prone areas promotion of commercialisation of microbial bio pesticides in tea cultivation and expansion of mother bush areas of new tea cultivars were underway during the year ,
national output expenditure income and employmentrubberrubber production continued to decline in for the second consecutive year largely driven by the combined effect of adverse weather conditions that prevailed in rubber growing areas fertiliser shortages and the spread of the pestalotiopsis disease ,
the impact of fertiliser shortages on immature rubber plantations during was significant causing stunted tree growth that causes delays in the tapping stage of plantations and reduces land productivity in the period ahead ,
furthermore the scarcity of agrochemicals resulted in severe propagation of the pestalotiopsis disease in rubber plantations during the year affecting around hectares of rubber plantations resulting in decline in yield ranging from per cent in affected rubber plantations ,
accordingly total rubber production decreased by per cent to million kilogrammes year on year in ,
among major categories of rubber production sheet rubber production accounted for per cent of the total rubber production with contraction of per cent while production of other categories of rubber recorded decline of per cent during the year compared to ,
however crepe rubber production recorded growth of per cent during ,
despite the notable increase in local rubber prices in productivity and tapping limitations in the rubber sector prevented plausible improvements in production ,
meanwhile the average yield of rubber reduced by per cent year on year to kilogrammes per hectare in due to the reduction in tapping days ,
the cost of production of rubber was on the rise and recorded at rs per kilogramme by end of registering an increase of per cent from the previous year ,
in the domestic consumption of raw rubber by the industrial sector contracted by per cent to million kilogrammes which was partially attributed to the decline in demand for medical gloves in both domestic and global markets as the covid pandemic faded away ,
the prices of most varieties of rubber at the colombo rubber auction reached historically high levels driven by the favourable demand in the global market during the first half of ,
at the colombo rubber auction the annual average price of ribbed smoked sheet no rss increased to rs per kilogramme in from rs per kilogramme in registering year on year increase of per cent while the average price of latex crepe also increased notably by per cent year on year to rs per kilogramme from rs per kilogramme in ,
nevertheless towards the latter part of the year rubber prices were on decelerating trend mainly due to weaker demand for rubber based products in both domestic and global markets ,
accordingly at end the average auction prices of rss and latex crepe rubber stood at rs per kilogramme and rs per kilogramme respectively ,
the average fob price of rubber also marginally increased to us dollars per kilogramme in from us dollars per kilogramme recorded in the previous year ,
strategies for improving the productivity and value additions in the rubber sector continued in ,
the rubber research institute rri conducted multiple research studies during the year in its effort to increase the productivity of the rubber sector ,
during the year research on the adaptation of low intensity harvesting systems was carried out with the aim of reducing production costs and handling labour shortages particularly in non traditional areas ,
as result approximately hectares of rubber lands owned by smallholders and plantation companies were converted to once in four days tapping system ,
screening of clones to identify resistant clones against leaf diseases was completed in in an effort to prevent significant yield losses caused by such diseases while measures were also underway to identify climate resilient clones for sustainable rubber cultivation ,
central bank of sri lanka annual report year programmes aimed at raising awareness among rubber farmers on improved techniques for applying slow release fertiliser and enhancing the nutritional intake of plants were carried out in several rubber growing regions covering monaragala middeniya matugama horana bulathsinhala kalutara kegalle and ratnapura ,
further the rubber development department rdd continued to engage in expanding the rubber cultivation extent through new planting and replanting activities during the year ,
under the new planting programmes latex harvesting was commenced in at the first established rubber field in mullaitivu in the northern province ,
measures were also taken to popularise different types of rubber based intercropping systems and crop diversification in unutilised lands through field demonstrations in different trial fields ,
meanwhile in the light of the rising cost of cultivation revisions were made to the subsidy schemes for replanting and new planting with effect from january in order to reduce the number of installments for the provision of subsidy funds from eight to five without altering the amount of the subsidy ,
a series of awareness programmes on sustainable harvesting through proper management of rubber bark was conducted with the financial support of the national science foundation of sri lanka ,
meanwhile training programmes on rubber product manufacturing targeting small and medium sized entrepreneurs as well as rubber smallholders were conducted during the year aimed at promoting value addition in the rubber sector thereby strengthening the integration of local rubber products in the global value chain ,

these favourable effects outweighed the immediate negative impact of limited application of chemical fertilisers on coconut cultivation during ,
along with the increased nut production coconut based products also witnessed an improvement during the year ,
accordingly the production of desiccated coconut increased by per cent year on year to metric tons from metric tons recorded in ,
coconut oil production increased notably by per cent year on year to metric tons in reflecting the restrictions imposed on the importation of both coconut oil and palm oil and the availability of adequate nuts for oil production ,
production of coconut milk powder also increased during the year by per cent year on year while coconut cream and coconut milk production recorded contractions of per cent and per cent respectively ,
despite improved performance of the coconut sector in the lag effect of delayed and insufficient application of chemical fertiliser in could affect the coconut yield in the near future ,
however the lag effect of favourable precipitation received throughout is expected to outweigh the negative consequences of insufficient fertiliser application ,
despite the improved coconut production prices of coconut and coconut based products remained at elevated levels throughout ,
the average retail price of coconut increased by per cent year on year to rs per nut in with nut prices exceeding rs towards late reaching historically high prices for coconuts ,
the average auction price of coconut at the colombo coconut auction recorded at rs per nut in registering an increase of per cent from rs per nut in ,

further the total export volume of desiccated coconut coconut oil and copra registered notable growth in reflecting the favourable support from the increased domestic production ,
the government efforts towards improving the productivity of the coconut sector continued during with the implementation of several initiatives aimed at promoting the sector ,
accordingly the coconut cultivation board ccb initiated several measures to provide high yielding coconut cultivars to improve productivity in the existing coconut lands ,
development of new coconut seed garden to produce high yielding kapsuwaya hybrid coconut cultivar was underway during the year while the hand pollination programme to produce kapruwana hybrid variety and infilling vacancies in the kiniyama seed garden were also carried out in collaboration with chilaw plantation ltd ,
several subsidy schemes including supply of coconut seedlings at subsidised rate subsidies for rehabilitation of coconut lands replanting underplanting and new planting were also continued in ,
in light of the increased intensity of white fly pest damage in pilot project was conducted to control white fly affected coconut plantations in the areas including dankotuwa nattandiya and wennappuwa while recommendations for controlling white fly disease using chemicals and bio chemicals were also issued during the year ,
further measures were taken to mitigate the impact of fuel shortages on coconut processing factories by supplying required fuel to ensure the uninterrupted operation of such industries ,
meanwhile efforts are being made to expand the global reach of the ceylon coconut brand which in turn will promote value additions in the coconut industry and create more opportunities in the global market for the country coconut industry ,

export cropsthe growth momentum of minor export crop production continued in despite the issues in domestic supply chains and fertiliser availability ,
according to the provisional estimates of the department of export agriculture dea the production of minor export crops recorded notable increase of per cent year on year to metric tons from metric tons recorded in ,
the government decision to maintain restrictions on the importation of several minor export crops as measure to curb import expenditure amidst bop pressures and combat the rise of prices domestically amidst increased global demand spurred farmers to actively cultivate these crops resulting in notable improvement in the performance of the sector ,
in the production of cinnamon clove cardamom coffee cocoa nutmeg areca nut and betel leaves witnessed growth while the production of pepper declined ,
the total export volume of the export agriculture crop sector registered year on year contraction of per cent while export earnings in rupee terms increased notably by per cent year on year ,
in the earnings from exporting cinnamon recorded significant growth of per cent year on year largely contributing to the growth of export earnings from export agriculture crops ,
several measures were undertaken by the government authorities to strengthen the minor export agriculture sector during the year ,
accordingly in arrangements were made by the export development board edb with the support of several public and private sector stakeholders to obtain geographical indication gi certification for ceylon cinnamon from the european union eu commission ,
this is expected to enhance the worldwide recognition of the excellence and distinctive features of the product which can be attributed to sri lanka ,
further dea carried out research and development activities to expand export agriculture crop cultivation into non traditional areas such as anuradhapura polonnaruwa ampara vavuniya and jaffna ,
meanwhile dea conducted various programmes aimed at introducing minor export crops like pepper areca nut ginger turmeric and betel leaves in these identified areas with the intention of expanding the cultivation extent ,
in order to enhance the quality of the production introduction and popularisation of organic cultivation good agricultural practices gap and good manufacturing practices gmp were also carried out during ,
