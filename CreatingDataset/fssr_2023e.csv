"XIThe financial sector, which experienced an unprecedented array of challenges in the aftermath of the economic crisis, continued to operate under challenging conditions.",
The overall economic contraction during the nine months ending September 2023 coupled with tax hikes aimed at supporting fiscal consolidation; and elevated price levels and interest rates resulted in strained balance sheets of economic agents.,
"Accordingly, financial intermediation1 witnessed a considerable decline reflecting the subdued demand and supply conditions for credit amidst a considerable deterioration in credit quality.",
"Financial sector exposure to the Government continued to increase amidst the fall in overall credit growth, highlighting imbalances that pose challenges to the financial sector.",
"While the approval of International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) in March 2023 brought in confidence, ensuing developments such as uncertainties about the sovereign debt restructuring process and the results of the bank diagnostics exercise raised some concerns on the sector.",
"Reflecting the early impact of monetary policy easing, the private sector credit-to-GDP gap (The Credit Gap), which reflects the status of the credit cycle, signals that the trough of the cycle had passed, and the cycle has entered the recovery phase.",
"With these developments, financial markets which witnessed extreme turbulence in 2022 demonstrated signs of stabilisation.",
Financial market’s stress as indicated by the Financial Stress Index remained broadly at low levels in the first ten months of 2023 as overall market conditions significantly eased compared to 2022.,
Volatility of share market indices gradually subsided though investors continued to be attracted to high yield investments in the form of Government securities.,
"Meanwhile, banking sector stocks also depicted high sensitivity to the Government debt restructuring process reflecting their high exposure to the sovereign.",
Comparatively subdued domestic macroeconomic conditions together with tight global financial conditions resulted in a low level of foreign investments in the domestic equity market.,
"The anomalous interest rate structure in terms of elevated yields in the Government securities market gradually declined, although not completely, mainly supported by the dissipation of uncertainties following the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) announcement,downward adjustments in the policy rates, reduced inflation, and anchored inflation expectations.",
The foreign exchange market which recorded an acute shortage of liquidity resulting in a significant depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee during 2022 witnessed an appreciation of the domestic currency with a gradual easing of liquidity conditions.,
"Improvement in market confidence with the approval of the IMF-EFF and increased inflows through accelerated export proceed conversions, workers’ remittances and tourist earning as well as restrictions on imports, Asian Development Bank and World Bank funds in the form of budgetary support contributed to the easing of liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market.",
"However, augmented foreign currency (FC) demand to facilitate the exchange of Sri Lanka Development Bonds under the DDO and subsequent relaxation of import restrictions contributed to the build-up of depreciation pressure on the domestic currency particularly during Q3 of 2023.",
"Domestic money market liquidity, which recorded a persistently high deficit during 2022, improved substantially during 2023 following the measures imposed by the Central Bank to reduce banks’ over-reliance on the Central Bank’s Standing facilities; liquidity injections through the provisional advances to the Government; forex absorptions by the Central Bank; reduction in the Statutory Reserve Ratio; liquidity provision via term reverse repo auctions; and Liquidity Assistance Facility granted to certain licensed banks.",
"Further, restrictions imposed on the standing facilities supported the reactivation of money market transactions.",
"The banking sector, which was adversely affected by the spillover effects of the recent economic crisis, continued to operate amidst challenging conditions while some signs of improvement were observed during the year ending Q3 of 2023. Credit granted by the banking sector contracted during the period albeit some 1  Financial intermediation is measured as the credit to deposit ratio of the banking sector.",
"FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW 2023 XIIrecovery was observed within Q3 of 2023. Credit risk of the banking sector as indicated by the Stage 3 Loans Ratio remained elevated, reflecting deteriorated debt servicing capacities of economic agents due to shrinking balance sheets amidst adverse economic conditions.",
"However, stabilisation of credit risk was witnessed during Q3 of 2023 as indicated by the slowdown in the increase of Stage 3 Loans.",
"Meanwhile, credit concentration risks persisted within the banking sector with some high credit concentration on certain sectors, namely, construction and agriculture, posing higher vulnerabilities due to economic and climate related issues.",
"In addition, the high exposure of the banking sector to the sovereign posed concerns for the sector, which necessitated the exclusion of banking sector investments in Treasury bonds from the restructuring perimeter.",
Increased investments in Rupee-denominated Government securities resulted in a significant increase in liquidity ratios of the banking sector while overall utilization of Standing Lending Facility by the banking sector reduced significantly.,
"FC operations of banks also witnessed a contraction during the period under review, particularly due to the significant decline in core FC assets despite the banking sector accumulating substantial amount of FC resources in the form of balances with financial institutions abroad.",
"Meanwhile, profitability of the sector improved with reduced new impairment charges compared to the previous year though comparatively lower impairment may have negative consequences for future profitability of the sector.",
"Furthermore, several banks including two Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) reported a decline in profits during the period.",
"Capital adequacy of the banking sector improved as a result of the decline in risk weighted assets, primarily due to the decline in exposures to corporate and retail loans and receivables, although a significant decrease in the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) was observed in D-SIBs during Q3 of 2023.",
"Going forward, banks are required to focus on strengthening their capital buffers supported by profit generation, considering the potential losses due to debt restructuring, results of the bank diagnostic exercise, and realisation of forward-looking impact assessment, which would raise recapitalisation requirements within the banking sector.",
"The loans and advances portfolio of the Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) sector contracted significantly during the year ending Q3 of 2023, particularly due to the restrictions on vehicle imports which affected leasing and hire purchase activities.",
"Amidst the decline in the core business, the LFCs sector diversified its activities particularly towards pawning/gold loan facilities which heightened the sector's risk to fluctuations in global gold prices.",
The asset quality of the sector also deteriorated as indicated by the increase in stage 3 loans to total loans ratio.,
"Meanwhile, overall liquidity of the sector remained at an acceptable level while few companies faced difficulties in meeting liquidity requirements.",
Exposure of the LFCs sector to the sovereign also increased amidst rising investments in Government securities.,
"Moreover, the sector recorded an increase in profit, driven by higher revenue from interest income and other operating income along with reduced new impairment charges while capital adequacy also improved, with higher growth in regulatory capital compared to subdued growth in risk weighted assets, mainly due to the contraction of loans and advances amidst higher exposure to pawning/gold loans advances and increase in risk-free investments.",
Successful implementation of the Masterplan for Consolidation of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) introduced by the Central Bank in the latter part of 2020 helped to build the confidence of the sector.,
"However, the continued need for consolidation exists in the LFCs sector to ensure resilience.",
The insurance sector witnessed an increase in Gross Written Premium (GWP) with repriced policies amidst rising price levels while insurance claims also increased during the first half of 2023.,
"Meanwhile, general insurance lagged behind long-term insurance in terms of profitability while liquidity ratios improved for both segments.",
"In terms of capital adequacy, these segments showed a divergent performance with the general insurance segment recording a decline in the capital adequacy ratio while the same for the long-term insurance sector improved.",
"Going forward financial institutions, particularly banks, LFCs and insurance companies would have to closely monitor their exposure to the sovereign and implement prudent measures to minimise such risks to ensure stability of the sector.",
"Moreover, Sri Lanka's payment and settlement system exhibited resilience despite the dynamic nature of the financial landscape and the evolving digital payment systems during 2023.",
"The strained balance sheets of the household and the corporate sectors in the backdrop of the severe economic crisis which resulted in an erosion of real income levels amidst elevated price levels, hindered the debt repayment capacities of households and corporates.",
"Household and the corporate sectors, which account for a significant share of financial consumers within the economy, witnessed a deterioration in credit quality during the period under review, highlighting concerns for the financial sector.",
"While time-bound Non-Performing Loans (NPL) ratios of both the household and institutional sectors2 increased during the period under review, the former was at a higher level indicating higher default risk within the household sector.",
"Moreover, within the household sector, the NPL ratio of loans obtained for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) purposes was higher compared to that of loans obtained for household purposes.",
"Meanwhile, in terms of credit issuing institutions, although the banking sector accounted for the larger share of credit issuances, the NBFI sector reported higher NPL ratio compared to that of the banking sector, indicating the subpar credit quality of the NBFI sector.",
The Non-Financial Corporate (NFC)3 sector also witnessed a deterioration in creditworthiness during the period under review as reflected by the decline in the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) and solvency of the sector which affected the credit quality of financial institutions.,
"Meanwhile, these developments coupled with relatively high interest rates during the period under consideration discouraged both borrowers and lenders from initiating new credit facilities.",
Numerous policy measures implemented by the Central Bank supported in ensuring financial stability during these turbulent times.,
The proactive build-up of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCoB) and the D-SIBs Buffer by the Central Bank may enable the banking sector to weather the unexpected losses arising from the economic crisis to a certain extent.,
The Central Bank also took measures to strengthen financial stability through the establishment of the Emergency Loans and Advances facility for licensed banks and a robust institutional framework for crisis management along with the range of policy measures initiated under the  IMF-EFF programme including Asset Quality Reviews (AQRs).,
A roadmap was also developed for restructuring and capital enhancement for selected banks.,
defined the resolution authority of the Central Bank while measures were taken to strengthen the financial and institutional capacity of the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme (SLDIS).,
"Accordingly, the Central Bank was vested with powers and the tools to achieve the macroprudential objectives mentioned therein.",
Within this context the framework for several other macroprudential policy tools were developed by the Central Bank.,
"These included the Counter Cyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB), Loan to Value (LTV) ratio on Housing loans and Debt Service to Income (DSTI) ratio along with reviewing of the D-SIBs framework.",
These tools will be implemented as and when required to address systemic imbalances and strengthen buffers in an environment of conducive underlying conditions to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector.,
"Moreover, the establishment of the stress testing framework, which includes dynamic solvency stress testing; liquidity stress testing; and interconnectedness and contagion analysis, enables the Central Bank to identify the build-up of systemic vulnerabilities in the banking sector, thereby facilitating a timely and informed policy making process.",
"Financial Stability Outlook
The easing of domestic monetary policy since mid-2023, is anticipated to facilitate the recovery in financial 
intermediation, which was witnessed through the gradual recovery in banking sector credit during Q3 of 2023.",
"This is expected to lead to a rebound in domestic demand and economic activity as witnessed through the  
modest economic growth recorded in Q3 of 2023, improving income levels and alleviating pressure on the 
balance sheets of households and firms.",
"Moreover, targeted stabilisation of domestic inflation at 5 per cent

repayment capacities.",
"Efforts are underway to address the Sovereign-Bank Nexus4 through policy reforms, 
aiming to rectify financial intermediation imbalances in the medium to long run.",
"Recent positive developments, 
such as reaching an agreement in principle with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the Exim Bank of 
China, contribute to the stability in the Government securities market.",
"The anticipated conclusion of External 
Debt Restructuring (EDR) is expected to further enhance stability.",
"Efforts are also required to improve 
sustainable foreign currency inflows to prevent external sector imbalances along with prudent measures 
towards risk mitigation by the financial sector.",
"Moreover, banks are expected to strengthen their capital buffers, 
considering the potential losses which may arise from debt restructuring, results of the bank diagnostic exercise, 
and realisation of forward-looking impact assessment.",
"Although it is expected that the existing macro-financial vulnerabilities would dissipate in the period ahead, with 
the envisaged improvements in the macroeconomic front, continued advancement along the policy reforms 
agenda envisaged in the IMF-EFF agreement is essential, particularly in the fiscal front to direct the economy 
and the financial system into stable grounds.",
"Any deviation from this path would bring detrimental and irreversible 
consequences to the financial system and the economy, though moving along this arduous and narrow path 
is challenging.",
"The instigation and operationalisation of strong and appropriate frameworks that proactively 
address vulnerabilities and implementation of timely, well sequenced, and consistent policies is also crucial to 
ensure the stability of the Sri Lankan financial system.",
"As the economy undergoes a monetary policy easing cycle, the credit cycle is expected to enter an expansionary 
phase, in which macroprudential concerns could build-up.",
"The Central Bank commits to monitoring these 
developments closely and implementing necessary policy actions to mitigate systemic risks and ensure financial 
stability through macroprudential interventions.",
"4 Sovereign-Bank Nexus is the interconnectedness between the sovereign and banking sector, to a degree that vulnerabilities in one sector could spillover to the other creating 
adverse feedback loops affecting their financial health.",

FINANCIAL STABILITY REVIEW 2023XVIII,
"Domestic macrofinancial developments continued to pose challenges to financial stability during the year ending Q3  
of 2023.",
"Reflecting the overall economic contraction observed during the period concerned, tax adjustments and 
elevated price levels due to past increases in inflation, a rise in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratios was observed as 
households and corporates faced balance sheet strains and narrowed debt repayment capacities.",
"Meanwhile, domestic 
business conditions have shown a gradual improvement yet remain below the neutral threshold while domestic inflation 
reached single digits since July 2023 after historically high levels prevailed in 2022.",
"Financial intermediation continued 
to rapidly decline during the period under consideration, which is an anticipated outcome of unprecedented monetary 
tightening in the past.",
"Subsequent to the dissipation of uncertainties surrounding the Domestic Debt Optimisation 
(DDO); and the decline in inflation expectations, inflation and the risk premia, anomalies observed in the interest 
rate structure of the economy during the recent past are correcting gradually.",
"As such, Government securities yields 
declined substantially while other market interest rates also adjusted gradually.",
"Meanwhile, banking sector exposures 
to real estate related activities remain elevated, with the stagnation observed in property prices and potential liquidity 
constraints faced by developers, posing elevated credit risks.",
"Banks’ tilted exposure to the Government created 
imbalances in financial intermediation and intensified the Sovereign-Bank Nexus.",
"The credit cycle, as reflected by the 
Credit to GDP Gap, underwent a high oscillation phase indicating heightened financial sector stress in the recent past.",
"However, it appears that the credit cycle passed a deep trough and entered into a recovery phase.",
"With the domestic monetary policy easing since mid-2023, financial intermediation is expected to recover, and 
domestic demand and economic activity are anticipated to rebound, thereby improving income levels, and easing the 
pressure on balance sheets of households and firms.",
"Domestic inflation is expected to stabilise in its targeted level 
of 5 per cent in the medium term, easing the pressure on economic agents’ purchasing power, while improving their 
debt repayment capacities.",
"Meanwhile, the continuance of muted global economic growth outlook and geopolitical 
fragmentation, if worsened could create financial stability implications via strained foreign currency inflows amid high 
import expenditure affecting the domestic foreign exchange market liquidity conditions.",
"The Sovereign-Bank Nexus 
and Banks’ tilted exposure to the Government are being addressed through policy reforms, which will correct financial 
intermediation imbalances in the medium to long run.",
"The country’s recent success of arriving at an agreement in 
principle with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the Exim Bank of China is a positive development and the 
envisaged conclusion of External Debt Restructuring (EDR) is expected to bring further stability in the Government 
securities market.",
"It is expected that these positive developments will enable the financial system to flow credit to the 
economy gradually, thus, supporting monetary policy transmission.",
"Further, as the economy is moving in a monetary 
policy easing cycle, it is expected that the credit cycle will enter an expansionary phase, in which macroprudential 
concerns could build up.",
"As such, the Central Bank will monitor the developments diligently and take necessary policy 
actions to reduce the buildup of systemic risk to ensure financial stability through appropriate macroprudential policy 
interventions.Macrofinancial

and Financial Conditions
Global Macrofinancial Developments and 
Outlook
Uncertainties surrounding  the global financial and 
economic outlook remain elevated amid declines 
in global economic activities and investments.",
"Long-term economic effects of the pandemic, the 
war in Ukraine and the increasing geoeconomic 
fragmentation, unprecedented monetary tightening 
policies adopted to tame inflation, withdrawal of 
fiscal stimuli amid high and rising fiscal debt levels, 
sovereign bank nexus and extreme weather events, 
contribute to suppress the global economic recovery 
and widen growth divergences among regions.",
"Despite these persistent challenges, declining 
headline inflation levels, COVID-19 no longer 
being recognised as a global health emergency, 
reorientation of global supply chains and the signs 
of easing global financial conditions, somewhat offset 
the slowdown in the global economy.",
"Amidst these 
developments, global investments have fallen short 
of pre-pandemic trends across regions.",
"Meanwhile, 
global divergences extend to the labour markets.",
"Considering the complex interplay of factors shaping 
the path of recovery, while recognising challenges 
and divergences persisting across regions, the 
International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) October 
2023 World Economic Outlook (WE O) updated its 
projections of global growth to fall from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 3 per cent in 2023 and 2.9 per cent in 
2024.",
"However, the ongoing war in the Gaza region 
could create regional and global repercussions if it 
escalates to the neighbouring regions and leads to

global inflation.",
"Global Manufacturing and Trade

global trade growth thus far in 2023 is anticipated 
to persist.",
"The Global Manufacturing PMI continued 
its declining trend until October 2023, reflecting 
the longest sequence of deterioration after nearly 
two decades.",
"The decline is primarily observed 
in intermediate and investment goods industries, 
contrasting with a rise in consumer goods production.",
"With the weakened demand, new orders decreased 
for the sixteenth straight month in October 2023, 
impacting international trade flows, with new export 
business falling for the twentieth consecutive month.",
"Due to the weakened demand and the muted 
outlook, manufacturers reduced staffing, purchasing, 
and inventory holdings towards October 2023, 
which indicates the continuation of the decline in 
manufacturing for some time.",
"Meanwhile, global 
trade growth also slowed, which is attributed to tighter

recovery; and persistent inflation, particularl y in the

"Commodity prices surged after 
the Russia-Ukraine war, but the effect was negated 
due to the sluggish demand pressure owing to

"The 
World Bank’s Commodity Market Outlook sees a 
limited impact from the conflict in the Gaza region, with 
commodity prices expected to fall further in 2024 and 
2025, driven by weak global growth.",
"Nevertheless, 
it is expected that prices will remain above pre-

consumers.",
"Geopolitical risks, especially if the Gaza 
conflict escalates and spreads in the region leading 
to substantial supply disruptions, trade restrictions 
and production cuts; adverse weather events that 
increase demand or disrupt supply and trade flows; 
and uncertainties related to global economic growth, 
particularly a stronger than expected recovery in the 
Chinese economy, could affect demand and supply 
conditions in commodity markets and cause price 
increases.Global inflati on decreased from its peak in 2022, 
driven by falling energy and food prices, albeit 
with a slow decline in core inflation.",
"Owing to 
lower global demand, which was driven by tighter 
global monetary policy, prices of energy and food 
have fallen, causing a decline in headline inflation.",
"As 
such, global inflation is forecasted to decline from 8.7 
per cent in 2022 to 6.9 per cent in 2023 and decline to 
5.8 per cent in 2024 by the IMF in their October 2023 
WEO.",
"However, the decline in core inflation remains 
sluggish, which signals that global monetary policy 
easing would be delayed and slow.",
"Persistent global inflation, which remains above 
pre-pandemic levels, necessitates Central Banks to 
maintain tight monetary policies.",
"While core inflation 
remains high, particularly in advanced economies, 
progress of declining inflation towards the pre-pandemic 
levels in emerging markets appears to be better, amid 
divergences across regions.",
"Furthermore, widening 
divergence of inflation and economic outlook may indicate 
the start of global monetary policy desynchronisation.",
"In 
the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report of October 
2023, the importance of central banks remaining 
vigilant against inflation; cautious emerging markets’ 
monetary policy adjustments; implementation of robust 
policies in China’s real estate sector; and enhancing 
financial sector regulation to mitigate risks have been 
highlighted.",
"Despite maintaining tight monetary policy, 
potential risks of sharp repricing of assets including

"The effects of 
monetary policy easing are expected to be reflected 
in financial intermediation, albeit with a time lag.",
"However, the adjustment in lending interest rates is 
generally slower than deposit rates during a monetary 
policy easing cycle.",
"In order to catalyse the monetary 
policy transmission, the Central Bank directed licensed 
banks to reduce lending interest rates in line with the 
easing of monetary policy and reductions in inflation 
expectations and risk premia.",

comparison to corresponding previous quarte rs.",

easing, the private sector credit-to-GDP gap

the credit cycle, signals that the trough of the

"The Credit Gap, which was on a declining

and is in the recovery phase, moving in line with the 
monetary policy easing commenced in June 2023.",
"Subsequent to historically high inflation levels 
during 2022, inflation reached single-digit levels 
owing to the lagged impact of tight monetary 
policy, normalisation of domestic supply side 
bottlenecks, appreciation of the domestic 
currency, the downward adjustment of global 
commodity prices and the base effect.",

prevail, among which some are transitory.",
"Value

"Meanwhile unfavourable weather conditions 
may also have a negative impact on the agricultural 
output, which could result in transitory food price 
hikes.",
"Furthermore, if upside risks on global inflation 
materialises, it could pass through to domestic prices.",
"Amid these upside risks, the elevated price level due 
to past increases in inflation and tax adjustments 
continues to keep expenditures of borrowers elevated 
which may raise credit risk.",
"Anomalies which prevailed in market interest 
rates during the previous periods, are adjusting 
alongside the declining inflation rate and the 
gradual decline in government security yields 
with the reducing risk premia owing to the DDO.",

eased the pressure on cash flow requirements of the 
Government, while partially correcting the imbalances 
in the interest rate structure of the economy.",
"With the 
envisaged conclusion of EDR, in which the country’s recent success of  arriving a t an agreement with the 
Paris Club is a step forward, further adjustments 
in the market rates and sentiments are expected.",
"Furthermore, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act,  
which was enacted in September 2023 restricts 
monetary financing, which further encourages 
effective Government expenditure rationalisation and 
revenue administration.",
"Accordingly, the Cabinet of 
Ministers approved maintaining an adequate cash 
buffer by the Government going forward.",
"Such 
developments towards Government debt sustainability 
would improve market sentiments and help adjust 
anomalies in the interest rate structure further.",
"Such 
favourable fiscal developments would also prompt 
rating upgrades and create positive feedback loops 
on macroeconomic and financial stability.",
"Fiscal 
consolidation together with state-owned banks and 
enterprise reforms envisaged under IMF EFF2 are 
expected to bring down excessive exposure of the 
banking sector to the sovereign and thereby correct 
the existing tilt in financial intermediation towards the 
sovereign and facilitate an increase in credit flows to

"Foreign investor 
confidence on the domestic economic, financial and 
governance aspects also weigh heavily on investment

"Moving forward, attracting long term foreign 
investments to the stock market should be a policy 
priority as an avenue to develop the market, while 
facilitating stable long-term foreign inflows that 
contribute to relieve the pressure on currency and 
contribute to reserve build up, thereby supporting

Risks emanating through domestic macro financial 
linkages are expected to ease gradually, but it is 
strictly conditional on consistent adherence to 
the policy reforms agenda.",
"With the easing of the 
monetary policy stance, benign inflation expectations 
and the reduction i n risk premia, the conclusion of  
DDO, and the expected conclusion of EDR, it is 
expected that market interest rates would adjust 
downwards gradually, correcting the anomalous 
structure while enabling the financial system to 
facilitate the flow of funds through the economy.",
"As a result, it is expected that economic activity 
would recover, improving income levels and thereby 
relieving the pressure on household and firm balan ce sheets leading  to an ea sing of credit risk of lending 
institutions.",
"Banks’ elevated e xposure to the Sovereign 
and associate d risks are being addressed through 
reforms to bring down the Sovereign-Bank Nexus, and 
it is expected that the tilt in financial intermediation 
would be corrected in the medium to long run.",
"Nevertheless, the path to sustainable economic and 
financial stability of the country is narrow and arduous.",
"Hence the continuation of the policy reforms agenda 
envisaged in the IMF EFF agreement and the effective 
implementation of such policies is crucial, particularly

in money and Government securities markets.",
"Decline in stock returns in October 2023 also exerted an upward 
pressure on the index.",
"With the decline in financial market stress, the volatility of the share market gradually declined supported by positive 
signals from securing of the International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) in March 2023.",

to uncertainties surrounding the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) perimeter, a negative signalling on banking 
sector stocks was observed which reversed after the announcement of exclusion of instruments held by the banking 
sector from DDO.",
"However, foreign investor participation in the share market continued to be low, indicating lack of 
confidence in macrofinancial developments of the country.",
"Meanwhile, the Government securities market indicated the continuation of its anomalous structure in terms of 
elevated yields, which however showed a gradual decline mainly supported by the dissipation of uncertainties 
after the announcement of the DDO, downward adjustments in the policy rates, and reduced inflation and inflation 
expectations.",

pressure on Treasury bill yields.",

"Outright transaction volumes in the domestic inter-bank forex market increased, while forward transactions were tilted 
towards less than one month settlement period during the first ten months of 2023.",
"During 2023, liquidity shortage in the money market reduced notably.",
"However, the liquidity condition was extremely 
volatile mainly owing to risk management practices of the foreign banks.",
"Call and repo markets turned more active 
compared to 2022, following the restriction imposed by the Central Bank on accessing Standing Facilities by banks 
and the Central Bank injected liquidity into the market via Open Market Operations (OMO) Auctions (reverse repo) to 
address liquidity shortages in the money market.",
"Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR) which moved along 
the upper bound of the Standing Rate Corridor (SRC) started descending towards the lower bound in the second half

"With the implementation of the IMF-EFF programme, the volatility observed in the financial markets during 2022 
dissipated to a greater extent and the markets became relatively more active.",

2.1 Stock Market
The share market volatility gradually declined in 
2023.",
"During 2023, market sentiments underwent 
significant shifts with the Government securing 
the assistance of the IMF.",
"However, economic 
contraction continued to dampen the performance of 
listed companies leading to a slow upward movement 
of share prices.",
"Furthermore, high yields diverted 
investors towards the Government securities market 
and elevated lending rates drove up investors’ cost 
of funding weighing down the upward movement of 
price indices.",
"During the 10-month period ending 
in October 2023, All Share Price Index (ASPI) and S&P SL20 Index grew by 25.4 per cent and 13.6 per 
cent.",
"Sub-indices, representing different economic 
activities of listed companies, demonstrated varying 
levels of volatility.",
"Banks and energy sectors were the 
most volatile whilst household & personal products, 
utilities, insurance, and health care equipment & 
services sectors were the most stable.",
"Banking stocks were sensitive to developments 
of Government debt restructuring.",
"Domestic 
banking sector investments in Government securities 
increased significantly as yield on such investments 
rose.",
"Banking stock prices responded negatively with 
the announcement of debt standstill and remained 
low, as uncertainties on domestic debt restructuring 
surfaced.",
"By end-June 2023, the Government 
announced its DDO perimeter, which excluded Rupee 
denominated Government securities held by the 
banks.",
"Responding positively to this development, 
investors rallied to bank stocks in mid-2023.",
"However, 
with the developments related to second tranche of 
the IMF-EFF disbursement, bank stock prices started 
to become volatile.",
"Investors continued to be attracted to presumably 
risk-free instruments than equity with on-
going economic uncertainty.",
"The positive market 
momentum following the DDO announcement led to 
higher return expectations in the share market from 
June to September 2023.",
"However, dismal profits of 
listed companies recorded in the second quarter1 of 
2023 considerably reduced equity return expectations

29Special Note 1
Systemic Risk Survey 2023
The Systemic Risk Survey (SRS) is conducted biannually to 
capture market participants’ forward-looking assessments 
of risks to the stability of the Sri Lankan financial system, 
along with their level of confidence on the financial system.",
"The survey gathers responses from executives responsible 
for risk management in financial institutions1.",
"This special 
note presents the findings2 of the two surveys conducted  
by the Macroprudential Surveillance Department (MSD) 
during the year 2023.",
"Confidence on the Financial System
Negativity in the overall level of confidence3 which  
exacerbated by end 2022, reduced during the year 2023.",
"The number of respondents expressing confidence in 
the financial system increased during the survey rounds 
conducted in 2023.",
"Consequently, the overall confidence, 
though remaining in the negative territory, moved upwards 
towards the positive territory, due to respondents recognising 
economic stability through controlled inflation (Figure 1).",
"Sources of Risks to the Financial System
Respondents were asked to rank potential risks based on 
the perceived severity of their impact on the stability of 
the financial system.",
"'Domestic Macroeconomic Risks' 
and 'Financial Market Risks' continued to be the primary 
sources of concern, as observed in the survey rounds of the  
previous year.",
"Moreover, concerns over the risk category 
1 The participants in the survey encompass a diverse range of entities including 
licensed banks, Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs), a Specialised Leasing 
Company (SLC), insurance companies, unit-trust managing companies, stock-
brokering companies, licensed microfinance companies and rating agencies.",
"2 Findings discussed in this note are derived from survey responses and do 
not convey the views of Central Bank of Sri Lanka concerning risks to the  
Sri Lankan financial system.",
"3 The overall level of confidence is measured by the Net Percentage Balance 
(NPB).",
"NPB is calculated by weighing 1 for ‘Completely confident’, 0.5 for ‘Very 
confident’, 0 for ‘Fairly confident’, -0.5 for ‘Not very confident’ and -1 for ‘Not 
confident’ responses.‘Domestic Macroeconomic Risks’ increased during the latter 
part of 2023 compared to H1 primarily due to the increase 
observed in concerns over GDP contraction and Inflation.",
"Concerns regarding 'Risks related to Financial Infrastructure' 
were mainly driven by payment and settlement system 
risks and changes in the legal and regulatory framework.",
"Conversely, concerns on 'Financial Market Risks' slightly 
weakened during H2 of 2023 when compared to the previous 
survey (Figure 2).",
"Mostly Cited ‘Sub-risks’4
Foreign exchange risk, which is a ‘sub-risk’ that is included 
in the survey questionnaire under the risk category ‘Financial 
Market Risks’ was the most frequently emphasised sub-risk by 
respondents.",
"Interest rate risk emerged as the second most 
frequently cited risk for the latter half of 2023.",
"Respondents’ 
concerns on these two sub-risks heightened for the latter part 
of 2023, as reflected by higher response rates of the sub-risks 
in the H2 of 2023 survey compared to the H1 of 2023 survey.",
"However, the response rates for the three remaining mostly 
cited sub-risks, namely inflation, macroeconomic policy 
uncertainty, and political risk reduced in the H2 of 2023 survey, 
when compared with the responses of H1 of 2023 survey  
(Figure 3).",
"Most Challenging Risks to Manage as a Firm
Opinions from respondents regarding the risks that 
pose the greatest challenges for firms (banks, LFCs/
SLC and insurance sector firms) were collected from 
4 A grid of 62 sub-risk categories which are classified into six major risk categories 
namely global macroeconomic risks, domestic macroeconomic risks, risks 
related to financial infrastructure, financial market risks, risks related to financial 
institutions and general risks were provided to the respondents.40

most challenging risks to manage by all three respondent 
groups.",

highlighted inflation and interest rate risk, as the most 
challenging risks to manage as firms.",
"Moreover, foreign 
exchange risk was noted as one of the top five challenges 
by both the banking and LFC/SLC sector respondents  
(Table 1).",
"Conclusion
SRS for 2023 results signal that risk perceptions of market 
participants gradually improved in 2023 compared to 2022 
though remaining in the negative territory.",
"While confidence 
improved, lingering concerns about domestic macroeconomic 
and financial market risks, as well as specific sub-risks, 
require vigilant monitoring and risk management strategies 
to ensure the continued stability of the financial sector in Sri 
Lanka.",
"These findings provide a valuable snapshot of the 
prevailing sentiments within the financial sector, offering a 
basis for further analysis and informed decision-making in 
safeguarding the stability of the financial system.",
"Financial Institutions3
Financial institutio ns, which were adversely affected by the spillover effects of the recent economic crisis, continued 
to operate amidst challenging conditions while some signs of improvements were witnessed during the year ending 
Q3 of 2023.",
"This was reflected in the gradual improvement of the Banking Soundness Index (BSI) during the year 
until Q3 of 2023 from its lowest levels recorded in the second half of 2022.",
"However, loans and receivables (credit) 
of the banking sector contracted during the year ending Q3 of 2023, amidst the tight monetary policy stance adopted 
until end Q2 of 2023, albeit a gradual increase in credit was witnessed in Q3 of 2023 with easing of policy rates 
by the Central Bank.",
"Meanwhile, concentration risk of the banking sector remained high at end Q3 of 2023, as 
credit was concentrated to six main sectors, which included a few sectors that displayed comparatively high risk of 
default.",
"Overall default risk of the sector as reflected through Stage 3 Loans Ratio remained at an elevated level 
at end Q3 of 2023 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year.",
"However, stabilisation of credit risk 
was witnessed during Q3 of 2023 as indicated by the slowdown in the growth of stage 3 loans.",
"The sovereign-bank 
nexus continued to be a concern as banks were highly exposed to the sovereign through investments in Government 
securities and credit to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs).",
"As a result of increased investments in Rupee denominated 
Government securities, liquid asset ratios of the banking sector significantly increased.",
"Although, banks experienced 
market liquidity stresses as reflected by the frequent use of Standing Lending Facility (SLF), it significantly reduced 
by Q3 of 2023.",
"Spillover effects of the standstill on repayment of certain categories of external debt, which was 
announced by the Government in April 2022, were felt by banks on their Foreign Currency (FC) liquidity.",
"Banks were 
faced with FC liquidity pressures from freezing of cashflows of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), repayment of Sri 
Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) in Rupees, and the low rollover risk appetite of counterparties amidst uncertainty 
surrounding restructuring of sovereign debt.",
"Consequently, core FC operations of banks  further contracted during the 
year, though banks accumulated a sizable amount of placements with financial institutions (FIs) abroad and maintained 
a positive net foreign asset position.",
"Despite reduced Net Interest Income (NII) of several large banks, profits of the 
sector significantly improved as banks allocated less impairment during the year ending Q3 of 2023, compared to 
the corresponding period of the previous year.",
"Capital adequacy of the sector recorded an improvement at end Q3 of 
2023 compared to Q3 of 2022, as risk weighted assets declined during the period, mainly due to the credit contraction, 
increased investments in Government securities, and the appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee.",
"Although Rupee 
denominated Government securities held by the banking sector were excluded from the domestic debt optimisation 
perimeter with the objective of ensuring financial stability, banks are required to focus on strengthening their capital 
buffers considering the recapitalisation needs that would arise due to the external debt restructuring, restructuring of 
FC exposures of SOEs, ban k diagnostic exercise, and forward-looking impact assessments.",
"The Licensed Finance Companies (LFCs) sector experienced a significant contraction in its loans and advances 
portfolio in the year ending Q3 of 2023, primarily due to challenges in its core business of leasing and hire purchase.",
"The restrictions on vehicle imports and adverse macroeconomic conditions compelled the sector to diversify its loan 
portfolio, particularly towards pawning advances or gold-backed loans.",
"However, this diversification poses risks, 
especially given the volatility of gold prices in the global market.",
"The asset quality of the sector deteriorated, indicated 
by an increase in Stage 3 Loans to Total Loans.",
"The liquidity position of the sector remained above the regulatory 
requirement, mainly due to increased investments in Government securities.",
"However, some companies faced 
challenges in meeting the minimum liquidity requirement.",
"The sector increased its exposure to sovereign risk by 
investing more in Government securities.",
"Despite the challenges, stable funding sources reduced the sector's funding",

of 2022, while asset quality and efficiency sub-indices

"Long-term insurance outpaced general insurance in asset growth, while claims 
were also high due to elevated motor repair cost.",
"General insurance lagged behind long-term insurance in terms of 
profitability while liquidity ratios improved for both segments.",
"General insurance's CAR declined while that of long-term 
insurance strengthened.",
"Amid these dynamics, the sector faces market risks with a significant share of investments 
in Government and corporate securities, necessitating attention to maintain capital adequacy for resilience against 
adverse economic shocks, if arises.",

"In April 2022, the Government announced a 
standstill on certain categories of its external 
debt repayments and  spillover effects were  
felt by banks.",
"Amidst uncertainties surrounding 
sovereign debt, banks faced FC liquidity pressures 
due to the low rollover risk appetite of counterparties.",
"Furthermore, banks faced FC liquidity constraints 
with the freezing of cashflows of ISBs in bank 
portfolios and repayment of SLDBs in Rupees and 
Rupee denominated securities.",
"Consequently, core 
FC assets of the banking sector (FC loans and 
investments) contracted by 21.1 per cent y-o-y at end 
Q3 of 2023, despite the banking sector accumulating 
USD 4.3 billion in balances with financial institutions 
abroad.",
"Contraction of core FC assets indicates 
reduced lending and investment activity in foreign 
currency, which could impact on the profitability 
of the banking sector.",
"On the other hand, core FC 
liabilities (FC deposits and borrowings) recorded 
a growth of 1 per cent, mainly due to increased FC 
deposits, particularly of foreign banks, while FC 
borrowings recorded a significant contraction of 36.7 
per cent y-o-y at end Q3 of 2023.",
"The reduction in 
FC borrowings was influenced by the downgrading 
of sovereign ratings to default category and delay 
in finalisation of the external debt restructuring 
process.",
"These developments affected the banking 
sector's capacity to grant FC loans, undertake new investments, secure new debt and/or renew existing 
debt arrangements.",
"It was also observed that the 
banks maintained an overall positive net foreign 
asset position  in FC, to manage regular operations 
and possibly to meet any upcoming obligations.",
"Nevertheless, despite t he provisions made by the 
banks on forex investments, the ongoing discussions 
with creditors on the treatment of ISBs under external 
debt restructuring may affect the forex liquidity of 
certain banks which hold sizeable ISBs.",
"Further, the 
restructuring of FC debt of SOEs will impact the FC

Special Note 2
Mitigating the Impact of Climate Risk on Financial System Stability
Climate change has emerged as a source of risk for the 
financial system with the potential spillover effects due 
to the rise of surface temperature which will jeopardise 
economic activity leading to volatility both in terms of 
price and financial system stability.",
"Climate risk could be 
identified in two dimensions, physical risk, and transition 
risk.",
"Physical risk depends on the physical hazard itself due 
to damage to property, agricultural crops, loss of revenue, 
etc.",
"Based on simulation results, it is expected that the net 
effect on global real GDP as estimated by OECD in 2015, 
will be between negative 1.0- 3.3 per cent by 2060 due to 
climate vulnerabilities.",
"Transition risk would arise due to the 
efforts made in moving towards a low carbon economy by 
reducing CO2 emissions which will require investments in 
decarbonisation and reengineering business models.",
"Paris 
Agreement demanded for holding the increase in the global 
average temperature increase to 1.5 ºC above pre-industrial 
levels (IPCC 2018), which was transformed via nationally 
determined contributions (NDCs) for the countries which 
ratified the agreement, leaving behind a major transition 
task towards carbon neutrality.",
"It is expected that by 2030, 
an additional investment of about 5.0 per cent of annual 
average GDP will be required for South Asian countries to 
meet Paris Agreement requirements.",
"Both physical and transition risks of climate change are linked 
to price stability and financial system stability of an economy 
where the physical damages will result in low production 
leading to increase in price levels while financial institutions 
will be exposed to increasing non-performing assets due to 
unsustainable business activities being financed.",
"It would be 
a twofold process to increase the resilience of the financial 
sector which will lead to a series of adaptation strategies 
while gearing financial institutions to meet the financing 
needs emanating from the sustainable activities as part of 
the mitigation strategies.Sri Lanka’s Climate Vulnerability
As identified by Volz (2020), Sri Lanka is among the highly 
vulnerable countries in terms of resilience to climate risk 
specifically on sovereign bond yields as per the Climate 
Vulnerability Index developed by Kling et al (2020).",
"In addition to the inherent risk the country faces as a small 
island economy, the current economic crisis has further 
amplified the vulnerability of the nation to climate risk.",
"Hence, 
the deterioration in the resilience of the country to face these 
challenges may in turn worsen the economic situation.",
"Unless timely actions on addressing the impacts of climate 
risk are taken, limited availability of low-cost funding for the 
expansion of the economy may lead the economy towards 
a vicious cycle in terms of recovery.",
"Thus, development of 
the financial sector needs to include sustainable financing 
initiatives that support the country’s adaptation and mitigation 
strategies in combating climate risk.",

"As ho usehold and corporate sectors constitute a significant share of financial services consumers in the  
economy, their developments have a significant impact on overall soundness of the financial system.",
"Accordingly, the 
early detection of vulnerabilities within these sectors and prompt implementation of mitigation measures to effectively 
curtail risks are crucial to ensure financial stability.",
"Within this context, the quarterly aggregate credit data of the Credit 
Information Bureau (CRIB) was employed to draw insights about the credit dynamics of Household and Institutional 
sectors while the financial information sourced from the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) served as a timely proxy for 
the assessment of the Non-Financial Corporate (NFC) sector.",
"Thus, analysis of CRIB data up to the end of June 2023 revealed rising time-bound Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) 
ratios for both Household and Institutional sectors with the Household sector recording a higher NPL ratio compared 
to the Institutional sector.",
"Moreover, within the Household sector, loans obtained for Micro Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSME) purposes indicated a higher NPL ratio signalling elevated default risks within the MSME sector.",
"Further disaggregation of NPLs in terms of financial institutions revealed that although NPLs in both bank and  
Non-Bank Financial Institution (NBFI) sectors increased the latter recorded a higher NPL ratio, highlighting subpar 
credit quality within the NBFI sector, which would pose further challenges for such institutions.",
"Meanwhile, both 
Household and Institutional sector credit experienced a notable y-o-y decline in debt levels by end June 2023 
amidst challenging economic conditions.",
"Elevated price levels, which constrained income levels, diminished the 
debt repayment capacities of economic agents, and limited their ability to obtain new credit facilities.",
"Moreover, 
deteriorating credit quality drove financial institutions to engage in cautious lending.",
"Hence, these developments raise 
some stability concerns for the financial sector which may gradually dissipate upon the recovery of the economic 
growth trajectory.",
"The assessment of NFCs unveiled a decline in the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR), indicating reduced margin of 
safety for timely debt repayment by these entities.",
"Moreover, solvency, which is measured by net profit as a share of 
debt obligations, declined during the period as well, raising concerns about the long-term financial strength of NFCs.",
These developments in creditworthiness were underpinned by the deterioration of revenue and profitability of NFCs.,
"Revenue growth of NFCs recorded a significant slowdown during the period reflecting the notable decline in demand 
amidst adverse economic conditions.",
"Furthermore, the fact that over 90 per cent of the increase in revenue emanated 
from two major players also highlights the uneven performance of the sector.",
"Meanwhile, the net profit of the NFC 
sector also contracted significantly due to a substantial increase in cost of sales, decline in finance income and 
increase in finance costs resulting in the deterioration of key profitability indicators during the period.",
"These findings 
underscore the challenges faced by NFCs and the risks emanating from such challenges to the financial sector.",
"Elevated price levels and interest rates within the economy during the period under review not only hampered the 
debt repayment capacity of economic agents but also impacted on their future borrowing potential as well.",
"In addition, 
the limited spending capacity resulted in the contraction in overall domestic demand which also impacted the income 
generating capacities of both households and corporates.",
"However, going forward, with the envisaged economic 
recovery amidst the current stabilisation in price levels and declining interest rates, along with implementation of 
prudent credit management strategies, and addressing sector-specific challenges, an improvement in credit quality 
in the financial sector can be expected, which would support the resilience of financial institutions and consequently, 
stability of the financial system as a whole.Household and

"Risk Assessment on Household Sector Credit
Reflecting adverse repercussions of the economic 
crisis, Household  sector credit experienced a 
substantial y-o-y decline during the period under 
review.",
"The level of credit in the Household sector 
which represents 42.3 per cent of the total formal 
financial sector lending4, reported a significant decline 
of 6 per cent as of end June 2023, compared to 8.1  
per cent growth recorded at end June 2022 
reflecting diminished demand for new loans from this 
sector due to elevated interest rates for loans and 
advances, deteriorating real income levels and high 
living costs.",
"Moreover, this highlights the reluctance 
of formal financial sector lenders to provide new 
credit facilities within the current economic climate.",
"Furthermore, the banking sector played a substantial 
role in meeting the borrowing needs of the Household 
sector, representing 70.7 per cent of the total, while 
the NBFI5 sector accounted for the remaining portion 
of loans obtained by households.",
"The NPL6 ratio of the Household  sector was 
steadily increasing, amidst constrained debt 
repayment capacities of household borrowers.",
"By end of June 2023, the NPL ratio for the Household 
sector increased to 17.7 per cent, a considerable

"Macroprudential policy aims at preserving the overall stability of the financial system by  mitigating systemic risk and 
maintaining the resilience of the financial system even under adverse economic and financial conditions.",
"After the 
Global Financial Crisis (GFC), it was evident that traditional regulation which focuses on the stability of individual 
financial institutions would not be sufficient to safeguard the financial system as a whole during a financial crisis of 
systemic nature.",
"Moreover, the GFC emphasised the importance of macroprudential policy in mitigating systemic risk 
emanating from the spillover effects of developments in the real economy.",
"However, macroprudential policy does not 
intend to replace traditional microprudential policy in safeguarding the financial system but rather to complement it.",

Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No.",

the macroprudential policy in Sri Lanka.",
"The Act has equipped the Central Bank with powers and a set of tools which 
could be utilised to achieve its macroprudential objectives of maintaining the resilience of the financial system, in 
a manner that supports the provision of financial services even under adverse economic and financial conditions, 
containing risks from unsustainable increases in credit and leverage, contain risks from interconnectedness within the 
financial system and controlling the risk of failure of individual systemically important institutions.",
The Central Bank has already made use of several Macroprudential tools in ensuring financial stability at present.,
"With the implementation of the BASEL III framework, the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCoB) which is a broad based 
macroprudential tool, has been implemented in Sri Lanka.",
"Further, the Central Bank has imposed capital surcharges 
on Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) to mitigate risks arising from such banks.",
"Moreover, cap on 
Loan to Value (LTV) ratio, which is a borrower based macroprudential tool, has been successfully implemented 
and is currently in force for credit facilities obtained for purchase of motor vehicles.",
"Furthermore, several other 
macroprudential policy tools such as leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, forward looking loan loss provisions, 
concentration limits, margin deposit requirements and restrictions on unsecured loans are being used by the Central 
Bank with the objective of securing financial stability.",
"Several other macroprudential policy tools have been developed by the Central Bank in accordance with international 
best practices to further strengthen its macroprudential framework.",
"The Central Bank has developed frameworks 
for macroprudential tools such as the Counter Cyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB), LTV ratio on housing loans and Debt 
Service to Income (DSTI) ratio.",
"The Central Bank actively monitors and analyses risks in the financial system on an 
ongoing basis and, where necessary, responds to changes in systemic risk and resilience.",
"With the expected economic 
recovery, the Central Bank shall apply appropriate macroprudential tools mentioned above or initiate changes to the 
existing tools to strengthen the stability of the financial system as macro-financial conditions may warrant.",
"In addition to macroprudential instruments, the Central Bank introduced several other measures during 2022 and

"CCoB is a broad 
based macroprudential tool which mandates banks to 
maintain an additional layer of Common Equity Tier I  
(CET-1) capital, on top of the regulatory minimum 
capital requirement.",
"The buffer is intended to act 
as a cushion that provides banks with capacity to 
absorb losses and continue to lend and operate even 
during economic downturns.",
"According to BASEL III 
regulatory requirements, CCoB is required to be at 
a level of 2.5 per cent of total Risk Weighted Assets 
(RWA) of the bank and when the CCoB of a bank 
falls below the threshold of 2.5 per cent, automatic 
restrictions for capital distribution (for example, 
dividends, share buybacks and discretionary bonus 
payments) will be imposed.",
"In Sri Lanka, CCoB was first announced in 
December 2016 and implemented in three stages 
over a period of three years.",
"Banks had to build the 
CCoB to 1.25 per cent of RWA with effect from 1 July 2017, then increase it to 1.875 per cent with effect 
from 1 January 2018, and then to 2.5 per cent with 
effect from 1 January 2019 to fully comply with the 
BASEL III standards1.",
"Considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and adverse macroeconomic conditions, the 
Central Bank allowed banks to draw down on 
their CCoB.",
"Extraordinary measures were introduced 
amidst the pandemic, allowing D-SIBs and non-D-
SIBs to draw down on their CCoB by 100 bps and 
50 bps, respectively, out of the total of 250 bps, 
subject to conditionalities, with effect from March 27, 
2020.",
"Further, amidst the adverse macroeconomic 
headwinds in the aftermat h of external debt standstill 
announcement by the Government, the Central 
Bank took further measures to allow banks to draw 
down on the entire CCoB subject to conditionalities2.",
"Accordingly, few banks utilised the option of drawing 
down on CCoB, however, all banks have restored

Special Note 3
Establishing a Framework for Interconnectedness and Contagion Analysis
Introduction
Interconnectedness within the financial system refers to the 
financial linkages or correlations observed in the market 
prices of financial institutions under various global conditions 
(Bricco and Xu, 2019).",
"Conta gion is characterised by a 
noteworthy rise in cross-market linkages following a shock 
affecting a single country (or a group of countries) or, more 
broadly, linkages that intensify after a shock impacting one 
or more financial institutions (Bricco and Xu, 2019).",
"High 
level of interconnectedness of the financial system has been 
identified as one of the main sources of systemic risk that 
contributed to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).",
"As a result, 
regulators began integrating network analytical tools and 
models depicting financial system interconnections into their 
routine analytical and policy framework.",
"(Fukker and Kok, 
2021)
Network and Contagion Analysis by the 
Central Bank 
The Central Bank developed a new framework for 
Interconnectedness and Contagion Analysis (ICA) in 2022 
which is based on a complementary Contingent Mapping 
(CoMap) model (Covi, Gorpe and Kok, 2021).",
"The new ICA 
framework extends the scope beyond the banking sector 
and assesses the contagion risks emanating from the 
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Non-Bank Financial 
Institutions (NBFIs) while factoring both solvency (credit 
shock and funding shocks) and liquidity channels in the 
model.",
"Credit shock factors the impact of a bank defaulting 
on its liabilities to other banks while funding shock represents 
withdrawal of short-term funding from other banks forcing them to deleverage by selling assets at a discount (fire 
sales) (Covi, Gorpe and Kok, 2021).",
"ICA methodology was 
further extended to capture contagion risk emanating from 
Non-Financial Corporates (NFCs) who are classified as top 
fifty borrowers of banks.",
"ICA analyses how a hypothetical 
triggering distress event (e.g., a hypothetical bank distress), 
cascades within the banking network as it transmits through 
solvency and liquidity channels.",
"Bank-specific default 
thresholds and liquidity thresholds have been defined to 
ascertain the level of contagion and level of vulnerability.",
"The development of the ICA framework is another step 
forward taken by the Central Bank in broadening the 
spectrum of macroprudential surveillance methodologies in 
the macroprudential policy framework of the Central Bank.",
"ICA is one of the three frameworks used by the Central 
Bank to assess the impact of hypothetical stress/distress 
scenarios.",
"The other two frameworks used by the Central 
Bank are dynamic bank solvency stress testing (see Special 
Note 3 in the Financial System Stability Review – 2022) and 
liquidity stress testing (see Special Note 4).",

"Then the LTV framework 
on credit facilities for motor vehicles was revised 
in 2017 and LTV limits were applied based on the 
vehicle classes provided by the Department of Motor 
Vehicles (DMV)9.",
"Subsequently, different LTV ratios 
were introduced for licensed banks and for LFCs and

period of initial registration10.",
"Currently, LTV for credit 
facilities granted by licensed banks, LFCs and SLCs 
for the purchase of motor vehicles which have been 
used in Sri Lanka for less than one year since the 
initial registration vary in the range of 25 per cent to 
90 per cent.",
"Meanwhile, LTV on facilities granted for 
vehicles which has been used in Sri Lanka for more 
than one year after the initial registration is 70 per

 The Central Bank is well equipped with 
framewo rks to expand the caps on LTV beyond 
the credit facilities granted for the purchase 
of motor vehicles.",
"In 2023, the Central Bank 
developed a framework to introduce a cap on LTV 
for credit facilities granted for housing purposes to 
strengthen its suite of macroprudential tools which 
can be implemented when the need arises to address 
systemic imbalances in the economy.",
"The Debt-Se rvice-to-Income (DSTI) ratio is a 
measure of the amount of debt service payments 
relative to total disposable income of an individual 
in the household sector.",
"The imposition of caps on 
DSTI serves as a borrower-based macroprudential 
tool used to mitigate unwarranted credit expansion 
within the household sector.",
"The purpose of DSTI is to 
limit banks’ potential credit losses and to mitigate risks 
associated with over indebtedness of households.",
"The Central Bank has developed the frameworks 
for this purpose.",
"However, the Central Bank has 
not implemented DSTI measures for any borrowers 
within the financial sector at present.",

Bank will continuously monitor the developments in 
the household sector and impose such measures as

to accumulate capital buffers during periods 
with favourable economic conditions where the 
imbalances in the financial system start to grow and 
risks accumulate due to high exuberance.",
"The buildup 
of capital through CCyB is designed to enhance the 
resilience of banks, enabling them to better withstand 
potential losses during periods of financial downturn 
when risks built up during the exuberance period 
start to materialise.",
"The CCyB, which is classified as 
a CET1 buffer requirement applicable to exposures 
within the geographical boundaries of a country, is 
generally established within the range of 0 per cent 
to 2.5 per cent.",
"Macroprudential authorities usually 
specify a neutral CCyB which ranges between 
1-1.5 per cent.",
"During the boom phase of a credit 
cycle, when there is a buildup of system-wide risks 
associated with excessive credit expansion or other 
cyclical systemic risks, authorities will require banks 
to slowly build the CCyB beyond the neutral rate, 
which generally ranges between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent.",
"Conversely, during a downturn, authorities release 
CCyB so that banks have adequate space to carry 
out financial intermedia tion.",
"A relaxation of the CCyB was witnessed across 
many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic 
as a measure to support financial sector 
resilience.",
"The Integrat ed Macroprudential Policy 
Database (iMaPP) of the IMF reveals that there 
are at least 85 countries, out of which 34 countries 
are Advanced Economies (AE) while the rest are 
Emerging Markets and Developing Economies 
(EMDE), where regulatory provisions are available 
for the implementation of CCyB.",
"It was observed 
that the 18 countries with a positive CCyB relaxed their buffer in 2020, which was the highest value 
reported since 2015, to maintain the resilience of the 
financial system amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.",
"This underscores the significance of maintaining the 
CCyB for a country.",
"The Central Bank has developed the framework 
and the country specific analysis methodology 
that supports the decision-making process of 
the implementation of the CCyB.",
"The Central Bank 
expects to introduce the CCyB in Sri Lanka with the 
revival of the economy i n the upcoming years when 
conditions turn appropriate.",

"As such, a range of measures aimed at 
improving and restructuring various aspects of the 
country’s financial system were initiated.",
"Accordingly, 
in line with World Bank Development Policy Operation 
requirements, the Central Bank enhanced the ELA 
framework for licensed banks and established a 
robust institutional framework for crisis management 
as a pre-emptive measure to safeguard the financial 
system.",
"During 2023, as a structural benchmark under 
the IMF-EFF programme, independent Asset Quality 
Reviews (AQRs) for nine domestic banks which 
account for more than 90 per cent of the domestically 
owned bank assets, were completed covering loans 
and advances both in foreign currency and domestic 
currency and foreign currency denominated financial 
instruments.",
"Further, the Central Bank developed a 
roadmap for restructuring and capital enhancement 
of the five large banks through careful assessment 
of the results of AQRs, forward-looking stress testing 
based on macrofin ancial scenarios, and the impact 
of domestic and external debt (including FX debt 
granted by state banks to State Owned Enterprises

Establishing a Framework for Liquidity Stress Testing
Stringent liquidity risk management is important for 
preserving the stability of the financial system.",

the resilience of the financial system against liquidity shocks 
is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in the system and 
formulating proactive policy measures to mitigate liquidity 
risks to enhance its resilience.",
"The Central Bank developed 
a liquidity stress testing framework for the banking sector, 
which represents around 62 per cent of the financial system 
of Sri Lanka.",
"Methodology and Implementation
Liquidity stress testing is a cashflow model which asseses the 
ability of banks to counterbalance the maturity mismatches in 
a hypothetical stressed scenario.",
"A template which identifies 
cash inflow-outflow mismatches and counterbalancing 
capacities of financial assets and financial liabilities 
denominated in LKR and USD and their respective maturities 
was developed by the Central Bank to collect required data.",
"The data collected were fed into the quantitative toolkit after calibrating the run-off rates1, roll-off2 rates and haircuts3 to 
generate a  stressed scenario.",
"The liquidity stress testing 
exercise is conducted on a semi-annual basis and the results 
are submitted to the governing board along with appropriate 
policy recommendations.",
"Way Forward
The implementation of the liquidity stress testing to other 
deposit taking financial institutions is another step towards 
broadening the spectrum of macroprudential surveillance.",
"The results and conclusions derived from the bank liquidity 
stress testing framework enhance availability of information 
used for the Central Bank's policymaking, particularly 
towards its financial s tability objective.",
"The scope of the 
stress testing exercise will be widened gradually to include 
Licensed Finance Companies.",
"1 Run-off rate is the rate at which categories of liabilities and off-balance sheet 
commitments are expected to be drawn down.",
"2 Roll-off rate indicates the fraction of maturing assets that is converted into cash 
inflow by the bank and not being rolled over.",

Strengthening Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT Framework: FIU Measures and  
Legislative Amendments
Introduction
Failure to comply with Anti-Money Laundering and 
Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) rules 
and regulations or having a weak AML/CFT framework can 
pose systemic implications particularly through reputational 
and operational risks.",
"A weak AML/CFT framework allows 
criminals to exploit the financial system for money laundering 
and terrorist financing activities.",
"This could lead to the 
infiltration of illicit funds into the economy, potential funding 
of criminal enterprises and terrorist organisations.",
"Further, 
a weak AML/CFT framework can increase operational risks 
for financial institutions and could undermine the stability of 
financial institutions and markets.",
"Inadequate due diligence 
procedures and controls may expose institutions to legal, 
financial, and reputational risks, affecting their overall stability 
and sustainability.",
"Most importantly, inadequate efforts to 
combat money laundering and terrorist financing can erode 
public trust in financial institutions affecting confidence on the 
financial sector.",
"Failure to comply with international AML/CFT standards 
can result in reputational damage for a country due to 
the identification as a country with strategic deficiencies 
in its AML/CFT framework (Grey List or Black List).",
"This 
may deter foreign investment, damage relationships with 
correspondent banks and harm the country’s overall economy.",
"Non-compliance with AML/CFT regulations may lead to legal 
and regulatory consequences.",
"This could lead to sanctions 
or restrictions imposed by international regulatory bodies, 
impacting the financial sector and broader economy.",
"Review Process of the AML/CFT Framework al
Through the periodic peer review process, countries are 
assessed by the international regulator to evaluate the 
level of compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) 
Recommendations and the effectiveness of measures taken 
to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.",
"The 
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) plays a key role in ensuring 
that stakeholders are taking all measures to strengthen their 
AML/CFT framework and the country is compliant with the 
FATF Recommendations.",
"Further, financial institutions as 
regulated entities are obliged to comply with the AML/CFT 
rules and regulations.",
"Accordingly, financial institutions are required to comply with the Customer  Due Diligence Rules, submit Suspicious Transaction Reports to the FIU, appoint a Compliance Officer to monitor and oversee that proper safeguards are implemented to protect the Institution, etc.",
"Sri Lanka’s 3rd Mutual Evaluation on AML/CFT framework, coordinated by th e Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), is scheduled to commence from March 2025.",
Sri Lanka is require d to ensure that the country is technically compliant with the 40 Recommendations of the FATF and the AML/CFT framework is effective under the FATF 11 Immediate Outcomes.,
"Together with the relevant stakeholders, the FIU is taking all possible measures to ensure compliance at the upcoming assessment.",
"Measures to Strengthen the AML/CFT  FrameworkIn order to strengthen the AML/CFT framework in the country, the FIU conducted the Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing National Risk Assessment (NRA) during 2021/22 and the sanitised NRA report was published in September 2023.",
"The National Policy on AML/CFT for 2023 - 2028 was developed based on the threats, vulnerabilities and risks identified in the NRA and the same was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 07.08.2023.",
The FIU has also drafted Action Plans to be implemented by relevant stakeholders to improve the effectiveness and technical compliance level of AML/CFT framework and the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was received for the same on 07.08.2023.,
The FIU is following up on the Action Plans provided to the stakeholders to address the remaining gaps.,
The FIU is also in the process of introducing amendments to three main legislative enactments that support the AML/CFT framework of Sri Lanka.,
"The approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has been received to introduce amendments to the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act, No.",
Passing amendments to these three legislation is important for Sri Lanka to address the gaps identified at the Mutual Evaluation carried out by the APG in 2014/2015 and to further strengthen several areas of concern in the implementation of such legislation.,
The cooperation of all stakeholders in ensuring compliance with the AML/CFT framework is important to manage the reputational and operational risks which may affect the financial system and the economy as a whole.,
