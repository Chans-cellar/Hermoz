"The Central Bank of Sri Lanka further reduce s policy interest rates  The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 23 November 2023, decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 9.00 per cent and 10.00 per cent, respectively.",Monetary policy
"The Board arrived at this decision following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments  in the domestic and global economy , with the aim of achieving and maintaining inflation at  the targeted level of 5 per cent  over the medium term , while  enabling the economy to reach  and stabilise at the  potential  level.",Inflation
The Board took note of possible upside risks to inflation projections in the near term due to supply -side factors stemming from the expected developments domestic ally and globally.,Inflation
"However, the Board viewed that such near -
term risks would not materially change the medium -term inflation outlook, as inflation 
expectations of the public remain anchored and economic activity  is projected to remain below 
par in the near to medium term.",Inflation
"Further, t he Board viewed that with this reduction of policy  
interest rates , along with the monetary policy  measures carried out  since June 2023 , sufficient 
monetary easing has been  effected  in order to stabilise inflation  over the medium term.",Monetary policy
"Hence, 
the Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary 
easing measures to market interest rates , particularly lending rates,  by the financial institutions , 
thereby accelerat ing the normalisation of market interest rates  in the period ahead .",Monetary policy

"Food inflation continued to be negative ( year-on-year) for the fourth consecutive month in 
October 2023.",Inflation
"The National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2021=100) based headline inflation 
(year -on-year)  was recorded at 1.0 per cent in October 2023 , comp ared to 0.8 per cent in 
September 2023 .",Inflation
"Both CCPI and NCPI based core inflation (year -on-year), which reflects 
underlying demand pressures in the economy, moderated further in October 2023, reflecting the 
subdued demand pressures in the economy.",Inflation
"A one-off upward movement in inflation is expected 
in the near term, driven mainly by the changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed by the 
Economic Research Department  
24 November 2023",Fiscal policy
"The spillover effects of tax measures and other 
developments are likely to be muted due to subdued underlying demand pressures ; hence, t his 
rise in inflation  is expected to be transitory .",Inflation
"Accordingly, h eadline inflation  over the medium term 
is expected to converge towards the targeted level of 5 per cent , supported by appropriate policy 
measures.",Inflation

the anticipated domestic fiscal path in line with the IMF -EFF projections  under the debt restructuring scenario  and key changes 
proposed in the Government Budget Speech – 2024 ; and global financial conditions implied by the monetary policy stance of 
the USA.",International trade
"Further, the proje ctions are conditional on the model -consistent interest rate path and the resulting macroeconomic 
responses.",Monetary policy
"Any notable change in these assumptions could lead to the realised inflation path deviating from the projected pat h. 
Given the prevailing domestic and global economic uncertainties, adverse weather conditions and geopolitical tensions, the 
risks associated with the current projections are higher than in normal times.",Inflation
"In particular, there are upside risks to inflation projections stemming from factors such as the possibility of increased taxes and related second -round impacts, 
possible wage hikes, large increases in  energy prices, any larger than expected exchange rate depreciation amidst relaxed import restrictions, the impact of possible adverse weather on agricultural production and in turn on food inflation, etc.",Inflation
"Meanwhile, downside risks to inflation projections include the possibility of a faster recovery of supply conditions and the sustained impact of diminished purchasing power of the public.",Inflation
