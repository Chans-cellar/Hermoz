"Several inherent 
weaknesses of the economy, further exacerbated by policy lapses, steered the country towards a multifaceted 
disaster.",Fiscal Policy
"Ill-timed tax reductions, an ill-equipped attempt to swiftly adopt organic agriculture, the depletion of the country’s official reserves amidst futile attempts to maintain an untarnished debt servicing record, the delay in the exchange rate adjustment, and the failure to pay heed to several early warning signals caused tremendous shockwaves across the economy.",Monetary Policy
"Consequently, the economy was battered by excessive balance of payments (BOP) pressures with acute shortage of foreign exchange liquidity and pressured exchange rate, spiralling inflation and dampened economic activity amidst mass loss of livelihoods, large fiscal imbalances, public debt reaching unsustainable levels with extraordinarily high risk premia, devastating sovereign rating downgrades that constrained access to external finance, unprecedented heightening of socio-economic and socio-political tensions, and rapidly deteriorating business confidence, among others.",Exchange Rates

imports to the greatest extent possible amidst a dearth of foreign exchange inflows and significantly low levels

"Moreover, the Central Bank initiated measures to prioritise essential imports and restrict 
capital outflows through appropriate control measures, while continuing the requirement for the mandatory 
sale of foreign exchange to the Central Bank by licensed banks, based on the conversion of repatriated foreign exchange, and commenced providing daily guidance on the exchange rate to curtail undue intraday volatilities.",Monetary Policy

"The Government initiated measures in early 2022 to seek assistance from the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) after months of indecisiveness.",International Trade
"The IMF had already assessed that Sri Lanka’s public debt had reached unsustainable levels, hence, any funding assistance from the IMF needed to be preceded by efforts to restructure public debt.",Fiscal Policy
"Subsequently, when it reached a critical point of inability to service debt payments, the 
Government announced a debt standstill in mid-April 2022, thereby suspending the servicing of external debt, 
mainly bilateral and commercial debt, as an interim measure, while soliciting support from official and private 
creditors to restructure outstanding debt.",Fiscal Policy
"Simultaneously, several initiatives were made by the Government 
to enhance government revenue, curtail expenditure, introduce reforms to major State Owned Enterprises

"In September 2022, a staff level agreement was reached for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the IMF, followed by efforts to secure financing assurances from official creditors towards the restructuring of debt, in line with the debt sustainability targets envisaged under the IMF-EFF supported programme.",Fiscal Policy
"In March 
2023, the Executive Board of the IMF approved the EFF supported programme of 48-months, amounting to 
approximately US dollars 3 billion, along with an economic adjustment programme that was aimed at putting  
Sri Lanka back on a recovery path, while addressing structural impediments that constrained the country’s growth potential over the past decades.",Fiscal Policy
"With a multitude of goals to be achieved under the IMF-EFF arrangement, restoring public debt sustainability through the debt restructuring process will be one of the key milestones in the path towards attaining a sustained growth in the economy.",Fiscal Policy
"However, debt restructuring could pose near term challenges in the financial sector that need to be addressed proactively by the Government and Central Bank, thereby reinforcing the financial system stability in the period ahead.",Fiscal Policy
Policy measures and reforms implemented by the Government and the Central Bank have yielded notable success thus far.,Monetary Policy
"Inflation returned to an impressive disinflation path following a historic peak in September 2022, and the exchange rate remained stable and registered an appreciation in early 2023, having depreciated sharply during the first half of 2022.",Monetary Policy
"Further, the external current account deficit remained modest alongside the gradual accumulation of official reserves, thereby enabling the reinstatement of exchange rate flexibility 
from early March 2023.",Exchange Rates
"The envisaged normalisation of foreign exchange flows and the completion of the debt 
restructuring process during 2023, and the sweeping reforms in the public sector, are expected to pave way for the country’s progress towards improved and sustainable economic prospects.",Fiscal Policy
"The socio-economic crisis in 2022 underlined many lessons that the country failed to grasp, despite 
the recurrence of such macroeconomic failures throughout its post-independence history.",Fiscal Policy
"This economic episode reiterated the essentiality of data-driven policymaking; devastating implications of ad hoc policy experiments; crippling welfare impacts of myopic populist policies; and the cost of policy delays, disregarding  
evidence-based policy analysis, well-established economic fundamentals and expert opinions.",Fiscal Policy
The general public and businesses at large had to bear the cost of a one-time adjustment of delayed structural reforms.,Fiscal Policy
"Against this backdrop, the Government, the Central Bank, and all other stakeholders need to extend their support towards the implementation of essential reforms at this juncture, to resolve the structural hindrances that have rooted in the economy over the last seven and a half decades.",Fiscal Policy
"Failing to execute such reforms would lead to perpetual bailouts, endless cycles of external borrowing and recurring debt restructuring alongside unsustainable and highly volatile business cycles, which would cause undue pressure on citizenry, preventing 
the country from achieving longstanding economic progress and prosperity.",Fiscal Policy
"Hence, in the country’s efforts 
to emerge from the current crisis, consistent and well-coordinated policies, including those outlined in the  
IMF-EFF supported programme, should be executed in a timely manner to avert another crisis in the period 
ahead.",Fiscal Policy

"However, the impact of significantly tight monetary policy and other demand management measures, such as prioritising essential imports, along with 
the softening of food and energy prices helped 
moderate the pace of headline inflation from the 
latter part of 2022.",Inflation
"Accordingly, year-on-year 
headline inflation, as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), which was recorded at 12.1 per cent at the end of 2021, accelerated to 69.8 per cent in September 2022, before moderating to 57.2 per cent by December 2022.",Inflation

ECONOMIC, PRICE AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY, OUTLOOK AND POLICIES
1High inflation during 2022 was a global phenomenon.",Inflation
"Global inflation accelerated to 8.8 per cent in 2022 (IMF, 2023) reflecting the impact of the lagged effects of ultra easy monetary and fiscal support following the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages of fuel and nonfuel 
commodities, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine War 
and capacity constraints along with supply chain issues.",Inflation
"Affected by global as well as domestic factors, Sri Lanka also experienced inflation at unprecedented levels in 
the year 2022, recording the largest increase in price 
levels in its history since independence.",Inflation
"However, in late 2022, inflation started moderating from its peak levels, showing early signs of a disinflation process.",Inflation
"This process is expected to be supported by several factors, eventually bringing inflation down to the targeted levels in the period ahead.",Inflation
"Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the concepts of inflation, disinflation and the characteristics of past global disinflation episodes, 
and more importantly, the envisaged disinflation 
process of Sri Lanka, as various misconceptions and misinterpretations have come to the fore resulting in confusion and affecting inflation expectations of the public.",Inflation
"The Concept of Inflation
A change in inflation is sometimes misinterpreted as a corresponding change in the price level.",Inflation
The general price level represents an average of all prices in the economy as measured by a consumer price index.,Inflation
"The most commonly used measures of the level of prices 
in Sri Lanka are the Colombo Consumer Price Index 
(CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).",Inflation
"In contrast, inflation is the rate at which the general price level increases over time, which is typically denoted as the percentage change in a consumer price index between two periods.",Inflation
"Therefore, a decline in inflation compared to the previous period may not necessarily 
mean a drop in the general price level, but rather a 
reduction in the pace of increase in the general price level.",Inflation
"The most commonly used measures of inflation are the 
year-on-year change and the month-on-month change in a consumer price index.",Inflation
"The month-on-month  
measure of inflation provides an assessment of price movements in the most recent month under consideration, compared to the preceding month.",Inflation
"Hence, this measure is also referred to as the ‘price BOX 1
Sri Lanka’s Disinflation Process
momentum’ or the ‘momentum of inflation’.",Inflation
"Inflation 
measured by the year-on-year change in a consumer 
price index, however, depends on two factors: the 
price movements in the current month and the price 
movements recorded one year ago.",Inflation
"The latter is 
referred to as the ‘base effect’, which is the contribution to the change in the year-on-year inflation that stems 
from the month-on-month inflation in the base period 
(i.e., one year ago).",Inflation
"The recent movements of the CCPI (Base: 2013 = 100)
1 and year-on-year inflation are 
depicted in Figure B 1.1.",Inflation
"The figure illustrates that the 
year-on-year inflation in a given month (e.g., Dec. 
2022) depends upon the consumer price index in the 
corresponding month and the value of the same 12 
months earlier (i.e., Dec. 2021).",Inflation
"Furthermore, the change in year-on-year inflation can 
be approximated by the month-on-month inflation 
in the current period (momentum effect), less the  
month-on-month inflation twelve months ago (base effect).",Inflation
"2 Hence, in order to assess the dynamics 
of inflation in Sri Lanka, especially the envisaged 
1 Compilation of the CCPI (2013=100) was discontinued by the Department of Census and 
Statistics (DCS) in February 2023 and it was replaced by the CCPI (2021=100).",Inflation
"Inflation  
(year-on-year) based on the CCPI (2021=100) is available from January 2023.",Inflation
"2	As	shown	in	the	mathematical	 representation	 below,	the	year-on-year	 inflation	(πt) depends 
on the consumer price index in a given month (Pt) and the value of the same 12 months 
earlier (Pt-12).",Inflation
"Once the mathematical representation of the year-on-year inflation is approximated using natural logarithms (ln), the difference between the year-on-year inflation in two successive 
months can be written as follows.",Inflation
"It is noteworthy that the approximation using natural logarithms is valid only when the 
variable under consideration (i.e., inflation) is a small number in percentage terms.",Inflation

"Sources of Inflation in Sri Lanka
Being a small open economy, Sri Lanka’s overall inflation is a combination of both domestic and 
imported inflation.",Inflation
"Domestic inflation is affected by 
demand side factors, supply side factors, and the economic agent’s expectations on the future course 
of inflation.",Inflation
"Demand side factors are typically the 
outcomes of a growing economy, public expectations of future price movements, and macroeconomic policies (i.e., monetary policy and fiscal policy) aimed 
at influencing the aggregate demand conditions of 
the economy, whereas supply side factors could be the outcomes of either the supply side policies of 
the Government or some exogenous circumstances, 
such as natural disasters, global events, etc.",Inflation
"As the people of Sri Lanka consume a considerable share of 
imported items, the country’s inflation is also affected 
by the movements in global commodity prices.",Inflation
"In 
addition, exchange rate movements affect inflation.",Inflation
"For instance, a depreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar (since most imports are valued in US dollar terms) will increase the price of imports in 
domestic currency terms.What is Disinflation?",Exchange Rates
"Disinflation is interpreted as a slowdown in the rate 
of increase of the general price level in an economy.",Inflation
"Alternatively, it can be defined as a sustained decrease 
in year-on-year inflation.",Inflation
"Disinflation is a process that 
typically takes place over the short to medium term until 
inflation reaches the desired level and price stability is restored.",Inflation
"It is important to note that disinflation, 
following an episode of high inflation, is different from 
deflation, which refers to a sustained decrease in the general price level.",Inflation
"Disinflation results in a lower level of inflation where the prices are still rising, but at a slower 
rate.",Inflation
"In general, gradual disinflation is brought about by 
contractionary monetary policy as well as supply conditions turning favourable.",Monetary Policy
"The objective of contractionary monetary policy is to bring back 
inflation to the targeted level and sustain it thereafter.",Inflation
"Disinflation policies could be associated with short term costs in terms of subdued economic activity and rising 
unemployment.",Unemployment
"However, the long term gains for the 
economy on account of reduced distortions due to high inflation outweigh the short term costs.",Inflation
"In the meantime, 
policymakers must also be vigilant of threats of future 
deflation during disinflation episodes, as sustained deflation can be highly destructive to a modern economy 
(Bernanke, 2012).",Inflation
"Globally, there have been several noticeable disinflation 
episodes.",Inflation
"The reduction in inflation in the US in the early 
1980s, when the US Federal Reserve was headed by Paul Volcker, remains a widely discussed macroeconomic 
outcome (commonly referred to as ‘Volcker disinflation’).",Inflation
"During the 1970s and early 1980, the general price levels in the US rose significantly.",Inflation
"However, following the 
implementation of aggressive monetary policy measures 
by the US Federal Reserve, the annual inflation rate was brought down from a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1980 to 
3.2 per cent by 1983.",Monetary Policy
"The US experienced two recessions 
during this period, which are generally attributed to disinflationary policies.",Fiscal Policy
"However, ‘Volcker disinflation’ laid the foundation for the long economic expansions of 
the 1980s and 1990s in the US.",Monetary Policy
"In the meantime, Japan 
and Germany also experienced heightened levels of inflation in the early 1970s.",Inflation
"However, by the late 1970s 
both countries recorded low inflation relative to other 
advanced economies.",Inflation
"The success of this disinflation 
process is attributed to the strong discipline of the 
respective governments and monetary authorities, based on the understanding that inflation in the long run is a Figure B 1.2

due to the expansion of the potential GDP in the long run through effective supply side policies.",Fiscal Policy
"Moreover, higher

are also weighed as possible causes for the considerable drop in global inflation from the elevated levels in the 
1970s and early 1980s (Rogoff, 2004).",Unclassified
"The Envisaged Disinflation Process in Sri Lanka 
Sri Lanka’s inflation started moderating from its peak levels of around 70 per cent (year-on-year) 
in September 2022, confirming that the disinflation 
process had started as envisaged.",Inflation
"In terms of economic 
factors, this process is expected to be supported by 
subdued aggregate demand conditions due to tight 
monetary and fiscal policies, expected improvements 
in domestic supply conditions, improved external sector 
performance, normalisation of global commodity prices, and the timely passthrough of such reductions 
to domestic prices.",Monetary Policy
"Statistically, the disinflation process 
is anticipated to be influenced by both the momentum 
effect and the base effect, with a higher contribution 
expected from the latter.",Inflation
"Moreover, the effects of statistical factors can be 
assessed within the context of sources of inflation and 
expected economic developments.",Inflation
"The IMF (2023) 
expects global inflation to fall in 2023 and 2024.",Inflation
"If the envisaged moderation in global commodity prices is 
passed on to domestic prices via timely and transparent 
adjustments, the price momentum of imported inflation could be kept at a considerably low level in 2023.",Inflation
"Furthermore, the stability of the exchange rate amidst 
an improved Balance of Payments (BOP) position would be helpful in this regard.",Exchange Rates
"The recent appreciation of the  
Sri Lanka rupee against the US dollar, if continued, could help lower imported inflation and reduce second-round 
effects associated with these imports, thereby supporting 
the disinflation process.",Exchange Rates
"In the meantime, Sri Lanka’s import prices increased disproportionately during 2022 
reflecting the substantial depreciation of the Sri Lanka 
rupee and the increase in global commodity prices.",Exchange Rates
"This resulted in large month-on-month increases in 
prices of imported commodities, particularly around  
mid-2022.",Exchange Rates
"In the year 2023, this will influence imported 
inflation favourably through a sizeable negative base 
effect supporting the disinflation path (please see Figure 
B 1.2).",Inflation
"On the other hand, with respect to domestic inflation, the price momentum is estimated to be significantly low on account of unprecedented monetary 
policy tightening measures and an extremely tight fiscal 
policy stance.",Inflation
"In addition, some improvements were 
witnessed in domestic supply conditions over the last 
couple of months.",Inflation
"As a result, the price momentum relating to food inflation recorded even negative values 
in certain months.",Unclassified
"The improved supply conditions are 
expected to continue through 2023, supporting the 
efforts to bring inflation to lower levels.",Unclassified
"Meanwhile, 
the adjustments made by the Government on various 
taxes as well as the revisions made to utility tariffs in 
2022 and early 2023, together with their second-round effects, resulted in one-off upward adjustments in the 
general price level.",Fiscal Policy
"Moreover, the supply side factors 
remained considerable in 2022 due to numerous 
shortages and bottlenecks witnessed in domestic supply 
conditions associated with the BOP crisis.",Unclassified

on-month increases in domestic prices in 2022 due to 
supply bottlenecks as well as tax and tariff revisions will 
influence inflation favourably in 2023 via a sizeable 
base effect (please see Figure B 1.2).",Unclassified

expected to be supported by a combination of subdued 
price momentum and a considerable base effect.",Inflation

"The Role of Inflation Expectations and Inflation 
Forecasts
The disinflation process of the country is also expected 
to be reinforced by well-anchored inflation expectations.",Inflation
Inflation expectations reflect the rate at which the stakeholders in an economy expect prices to change in the future.,Inflation
"Inflation expectations matter because actual 
inflation depends, in part, on what the public expects 
it to be, as expectations could influence spending, 
borrowing and investment decisions today.",Inflation
"Therefore, 
the disinflation process involves a deliberate course of action by a central bank to change the prevailing 
expectations of economic agents, if such expectations 
are higher than the medium term inflation target.",Inflation
"In Sri Lanka, inflation expectations destabilised to some extent following the high inflation episode in 2022.",Inflation
"However, with the proactive implementation of remedial monetary 
policy measures, along with an effective and transparent monetary policy communications strategy, including the publication of medium term inflation projections, 
a persistent reduction in the expected level of inflation 
was observed recently among the public, which in turn 
has helped improve the credibility of the Central Bank 
as well.",Monetary Policy
"As the disinflation process progresses, a further improvement in this regard can be expected, affirming the anchoring of medium term inflation expectations in line with the Central Bank’s inflation target.",Monetary Policy
"Frequent communication of the estimated short to 
medium term inflation path remains a key element of the 
disinflation process.",Monetary Policy
"Towards this end, the Central Bank will continue to publish its inflation fan chart in press releases following regular monetary policy reviews and 
in other communiqués as appropriate.",Monetary Policy
"Any discrepancy 
between the medium term inflation forecast and the inflation target prompts policy measures to close the 
gap.",Monetary Policy
"Frequent and transparent communication of the 
inflation path would also serve as a mechanism to ensure commitment from the Central Bank to restore and maintain price stability.",Monetary Policy
"Further, the Central Bank will commence publishing a 
forward looking semi-annual monetary policy report from the second half of 2023.",Monetary Policy
"This report will mainly 
display medium term projections for inflation and the 
underlying factors for the projections as well as an explanation of the deviation of actual inflation from the published forecast, if any.",Monetary Policy
"A key factor for the disinflation process is the credibility 
of the central bank, as discussed above.",Monetary Policy
"This will help 
anchor inflation expectations.",Monetary Policy
"The credibility of the 
Central Bank is highly related to the independence of the Bank.",Monetary Policy
"In this regard, the envisaged enactment of the new Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act will contribute 
immensely to improving the independence and 
credibility of the Central Bank, which in turn will support the current disinflation episode and further strengthen the anchoring of inflation expectations.Figure B 1.4

"Following the 
staff level agreement reached with the IMF for the 
EFF supported programme in September 2022, Sri Lanka commenced a dialogue with bilateral creditors to secure financing assurances, while engaging with commercial creditors in good faith negotiations.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, Sri Lanka initiated measures to complete all prior actions needed to secure the approval of the IMF Executive Board.",Fiscal Policy
"Towards the finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement, several favourable developments were initiated from early 2023.",Fiscal Policy
"With a view to encouraging activity in the domestic forex 
market and restoring a market driven exchange 
rate in line with the flexible inflation targeting framework of the Central Bank, the Central Bank commenced a gradual relaxation of the daily variation band, while also loosening the mandatory sales requirement by licensed banks, before completely removing this requirement from early March 2023.",International Trade

"Reflecting the impact of improving foreign exchange market conditions, the exchange rate showed a large appreciation bias during early March 2023, correcting the

1Introduction
The Sri Lankan economy has been experiencing 
frequent incidences of vulnerabilities and instability 
conditions instilled by structural macroeconomic problems coupled with global and domestic shocks.",Unclassified
"The conditions weakened drastically since 2020 with 
the onset of the pandemic, along with ad-hoc policy 
changes that exacerbated stresses in the economy.",Unclassified
"As a result, the country experienced severe Balance 
of Payments (BOP) distress and subsequently multiple crises in 2022.",GDP Growth
Several policy interventions were rolled out since early 2022 to guide the economy towards greater stability.,Fiscal Policy
"Seeking financial assistance 
subject to macroeconomic stabilisation and related 
commencement of debt restructuring efforts to restore 
public debt sustainability are key steps that have been 
taken towards this journey.",Fiscal Policy
"Before 2022, Sri Lanka had entered into numerous International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes from time to time for various 
purposes including supporting the BOP and the 
Government’s reform agenda.",Monetary Policy
"However, unlike on 
previous occasions, Sri Lanka initiated discussions with 
the IMF in early 2022 for an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement under the direst economic conditions.",Monetary Policy
"The success of policy interventions was constrained by debt 
overhang as well as persistently large fiscal and BOP 
financing needs.",Fiscal Policy
"Amidst continuous downgrades in sovereign ratings, Sri Lanka was cut off from avenues 
for external financing, making new fundraising and 
servicing existing loans extremely challenging.",International Trade
"Usable reserves depleted to near zero levels, the exchange 
rate depreciated at an unprecedented scale, access to 
fuel, electricity and other essential imported items by the public was limited, general price levels escalated to new heights with demand pressures and supply 
shortages, financial system stability was under threat, 
and social and political clashes were recurring in early 2022.",Exchange Rates
"Against this backdrop, the need for economic 
stabilisation with external assistance was required and 
the Sri Lankan authorities initiated discussions with the IMF.",Monetary Policy
"Continuous engagements over a year with the IMF staff team on the finalisation of the proposed economic 
and financial policies and successful completion of 
prescribed prior actions under the programme and the receipt of financial assurances from the official 
creditors enabled the approval of an EFF in late March 
2023.",Monetary Policy
"Salient features of this economic adjustment programme, expected developments under the EFF 
arrangement, the country’s commitment to the reforms 
in the ensuing period, and necessity of continuing this programme over four years are discussed briefly in the 
following sections.",Fiscal Policy

"However, the proceeds 
under the EFF would also help cushion the BOP by supplementing the Gross Official Reserves (GOR).",Monetary Policy
"The 
disbursement will be equally divided into nine tranches 
subject to semi-annual reviews and subsequent Executive Board approvals.",Monetary Policy
The first tranche was received in March 2023 immediately following Board approval.,Monetary Policy
"The 
programme aims at restoring macroeconomic stability at 
large.",Unclassified
"This overall economic stability is designed to be achieved through building strong pillars on critical areas 
of restoring debt sustainability, advancing revenue based 
fiscal consolidation, restoring price stability and building external buffers, ensuring financial stability, reducing corruption vulnerabilities, and raising potential growth.",Fiscal Policy
"Prior Actions and Structural Benchmarks
Since the commencement of negotiations for the IMF-EFF  
arrangement in early 2022, Sri Lanka has completed 
nine prior actions by March 2023 and has formulated a 
mechanism for meeting the structural benchmarks.",Fiscal Policy
The completion of these prior actions was instrumental in paving the way for broader reforms to be implemented in the next four years under the EFF.,Fiscal Policy
"The prior actions 
that have been already completed by Sri Lanka include, 
obtaining Cabinet approval for revenue measures to support fiscal consolidation during 2023 in line with 
programme parameters, obtaining Parliamentary approval 
for a revised 2022 budget, submission of the 2023 Appropriation Bill to the Parliament, obtaining Cabinet approval to automate monthly retail fuel price adjustment, 
to automate semi-annual cost-recovery based electricity 
price adjustment, Cabinet approval of the new Central Bank Act, Cabinet approval for the amendments to the Banking Act, strengthening key elements of the Central Bank’s crisis management powers, hiring an independent firm to 
conduct banking sector diagnostic exercise, and increasing 
policy interest rates by 100 basis points to ensure forward looking real policy interest rates are on a firm upward path.",Fiscal Policy
"In addition to the above, three important upfront 
measures were also implemented which include 
Parliamentary approval of the 2023 budget that was in line with programme parameters, Parliamentary approval of necessary legislative revisions to implement the 2023 revenue measures, and updating the 
Emergency Liquidity Assistance framework for banks.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, Sri Lanka is required to implement several structural benchmarks related to fiscal matters, State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), social safety net reforms, 
and monetary and exchange rate policies and reforms 
related to fiscal sector and governance in the period ahead, as detailed in Figure B 2.1.",Fiscal Policy

1Expected Developments under the IMF-EFF 
Arrangement
Some of the key expected outcomes of the IMF-EFF 
arrangement are as follows: 
•	Achieving debt sustainability: To achieve debt 
sustainability, Sri Lanka needs to achieve specific 
debt financing and debt servicing related targets.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, the debt restructuring process will be guided by quantitative targets developed under the IMF 
Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework 
(SRDSF) in order to ensure debt reduction, manage rollover risks, avoid a renewed buildup of external pressures from debt service needs, and ensure that 
financing gaps during the programme period are closed.",Fiscal Policy
"Meeting these requirements would ensure 
Sri Lanka’s public debt returning to sustainable levels in the eyes of creditors and the international community, thus easing difficulties and risk premia attached to Sri Lanka’s future borrowings.",Fiscal Policy
"The debt sustainability targets as per the Debt 
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) carried out by the IMF 
that needs to be achieved by Sri Lanka through the debt restructuring process are as follows:
 - Debt stock: Public debt to decline below  
95 per cent of GDP by 2032.",Fiscal Policy
,Inflation
"•	Improved fiscal performance and discipline:  
With the emphasis given in the programme on the fiscal front and the relevant structural benchmarks, it is expected that the Government will persist with its fiscal consolidation efforts to meet the fiscal 
targets through revenue enhancement measures 
and rationalisation of expenditure further.",Fiscal Policy
"With constrained access to monetisation of deficits going forward, the Government is expected to make required adjustments during the available Figure B 2.3

"A new Public Financial Management (PFM) law will be enacted to streamline the budget 
formulation process and to enhance accountability 
mechanism in public finance.",Unclassified
"•	Reforming social safety nets: Despite an increase in social safety nets related spending and beneficiaries in recent years, it has been identified that there is significant scope for improvement regarding the coverage and selection.",Unclassified
"Considering 
the issues prevailing in the existing social safety 
nets framework, the IMF-EFF arrangement has specified certain institutional reforms to improve efficiency, coverage, and targeting of social safety nets programmes.",Unclassified
"•	Restoring price stability:  The Central Bank is 
expected to restore price stability by driving inflation in a steady disinflation path to bring it back to the targeted range under the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework through appropriate monetary policy actions.",Unclassified
"As a part of this process, monetary financing to the Government is expected to be phased out.",Monetary Policy
"The 
price stability commitment also entails maintaining 
more flexibility in the exchange rate and rebuilding reserves to withstand future shocks.",Monetary Policy
"•	Strengthening financial institutions and financial system stability: The IMF is of the view that Sri Lanka’s financial system is heavily exposed to 
the public sector, moderately capitalised, and could 
face material capital and forex shortfalls following a debt restructuring.",Unclassified
"Consequently, there is a possibility that banks could face significant capital 
and forex shortfalls as a result of a sovereign debt 
restructuring.",Unclassified
"Therefore, plans are under way for the capital restoration of systemic banks following asset quality reviews to strengthen the resilience of 
the state owned banks.",Unclassified
"Meanwhile, financial sector 
supervision and the crisis management framework 
will be strengthened to make Sri Lanka’s financial 
system more robust.",Unclassified
"In addition to these specific benefits, the IMF supported programme would bring several positive spillovers to the economy through improved investor confidence, 
possible sovereign rating upgrades, and reopening 
of access to markets, among others.",Unclassified
"Considering the challenging nature of the targets set out, the authorities will have to put in a lot of effort and show 
commitment to ensuring the successful completion of the programme throughout the programme period.",Unclassified
"Also, in view of the maintenance of political and social 
stability during the programme period, especially 
considering the possible initial unpopularity of the reform measures and consequent public dissent, public awareness of how initial sacrifices would lead to long term economic benefits needs to be created.",GDP Growth
"Reforms Agenda Beyond the IMF-EFF 
Arrangement
The success of the IMF-EFF arrangement will largely 
rest on the extent to which the long neglected structural reforms are implemented.",GDP Growth
"The structural reforms are anticipated to boost the competitiveness 
of the economy, provide a foundation for productivity 
enhancement, increase the efficiency in resource utilisation, and thereby enhance the growth potential.",GDP Growth
"The severity of the current economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka highlights the importance of addressing the longstanding structural issues in a sustainable 
manner beyond the reforms agenda in the IMF 
programme through national policies which are formulated in consultation with stakeholders and free from political influences with vested interests.",Unclassified
"In this regard, the reforms agenda should focus on improving the productivity and output of the economy through 
technological innovations and increased economic 
connectivity to the world over trade and investment, by enhancing diversity in merchandise exports and potential services export sectors including tourism, IT/BPO sectors, and attracting FDI.",International Trade
"It is also necessary to strengthen legal frameworks to ensure public accountability of state institutions, exercising available 
legal powers in policy formulation and implementation 
by relevant authorities to ensure lasting economic welfare in the country.",Fiscal Policy
These would complement the reforms agenda in the IMF-EFF arrangement to ensure that Sri Lanka attains and sustains macroeconomic stability in the earliest possible timeframe.,Monetary Policy
"Conclusion
Despite being part of sixteen programmes since the first in 1965, only a few IMF programmes in Sri Lanka have been successfully implemented by authorities.",GDP Growth
"This has been mainly due to the lack of commitment to meeting 
the conditionalities attached to such programmes, 
especially those related to structural reforms, which required painful macroeconomic adjustments and unpopular policies that were aimed at long term welfare enhancements.",Unclassified
"Therefore, it is imperative that Sri Lanka internalises these reforms in its policy formulation and implements the major areas of reforms in the current IMF programme as well as reforms beyond the programme 
to help the economy transform into greater stability and 
a higher growth path at the earliest while circumventing the need for repeated access to IMF bailouts and several rounds of debt restructuring in the future.",Fiscal Policy

reforms to address fiscal sector vulnerabilities, 
while taking measures to restructure public debt aimed at ensuring debt sustainability over the medium term.",Fiscal Policy
"The budgetary estimates 
presented in the Budget 2022 were proved 
unachievable, due to low revenue collection during the first half of 2022 and expenditure overruns owing to high domestic interest rates and inflation.",Fiscal Policy
"The Government implemented an array of fiscal consolidation measures since April 2022 and obtained Parliamentary approval for an Interim Budget 2022 in September 2022, aimed at strengthening revenue enhancement measures and fiscal consolidation efforts.",Fiscal Policy

"1,979.2 billion in 2022.",GDP Growth
"However, owing to the substantial increase of nominal GDP with a large deflator, government revenue as a percentage of GDP fell to 8.2 per cent in 2022 from 8.3 per cent in 2021.",GDP Growth
"Increased  
revenue mobilisation from income taxes, Value Added Tax (VAT), Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL), and excise duties on liquor and cigarettes contributed to the nominal growth in government tax revenue.",Fiscal Policy
"However, revenue collection from import duty, Special Commodity Levy (SCL), and CESS declined during 2022, reflecting the impact of moderation of import expenditure.",International Trade
"Meantime, collection from non tax revenue increased on account of higher fees and charges, and profits distributed by the Central Bank based on annual financial statements of 2021.",Fiscal Policy
The implementation of several revenue enhancement measures during the second half of 2022 and in early 2023 is expected to deliver its full impact during 2023.,Fiscal Policy
"On the other hand, government expenditure and net lending, in nominal terms, increased by 27.0 per cent,  
year-on-year, in 2022, despite the Government’s 
expenditure rationalisation measures.",Fiscal Policy
"However, 
with the notable nominal GDP growth, government expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, decreased 
to 18.5 per cent in 2022 from 20.0 per cent in the 
previous year.",Fiscal Policy
"Higher expenditure on account of domestic interest payments, salaries and wages, and subsidies and transfers contributed to the 
increase in recurrent expenditure.",Fiscal Policy
"Simultaneously, 
capital expenditure and net lending also registered a year-on-year growth of 23.1 per cent, especially

"monetary Sector developments
The central bank continued the tight 
monetary policy stance throughout 2022 with a 
significant increase in policy interest rates of 700 
basis points in april 2022.",Monetary Policy
"Such large monetary 
policy tightening was necessitated to contain rising 
inflationary pressures, address vulnerabilities in the 
external sector and anchor inflation expectations, 
thereby preventing possible hyperinflation and 
prolonged loss of economic activity.",Monetary Policy
"Accordingly, 
since the monetary tightening cycle that began in August 2021, the Central Bank’s key policy interest 
rates, i.e., the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) 
and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR), were raised by 10 percentage points by end 2022.",Monetary Policy
"The 
unprecedented upward adjustment of policy interest 
rates by 700 basis points in April 2022 helped arrest 
the further build-up of demand driven inflationary 
pressures, thereby preempting the escalation of adverse inflationary expectations, easing the pressure on the external sector, and correcting anomalies observed in the market interest rate structure.",Monetary Policy
"In addition, regulatory measures, including the removal of maximum interest rates imposed on selected lending products, and foreign currency deposits were also taken by the Central Bank, enabling the effective 
passthrough of policy interest rate changes to tighten 
monetary conditions.",Monetary Policy
"Meanwhile, liquidity levels in 
the domestic money market continued to remain at 
high deficit levels, particularly during the first half of 
2022, due to foreign exchange sales by the Central Bank for facilitating imports of essentials, net foreign loan repayments of the Government, net currency withdrawals by the public from the banking system, and maturities of foreign currency buy-sell swaps with domestic banks.",Monetary Policy
"However, reflecting the impact of the primary purchases of government securities by the Central Bank and an increase in currency deposits to the banking system with high deposit interest rates, amidst the conduct of long term reverse repo auctions on a need basis, a gradual improvement in the domestic money market liquidity was observed towards the latter part of 2022.",Monetary Policy
"Due to the combined impact of a faster passthrough of the increase in policy interest rates, tight liquidity conditions in the domestic 
money market and elevated risk premia, market 
deposit and lending interest rates rose significantly in 2022.",Monetary Policy
"Subsequent to the sharp increase in key 
policy interest rates, amidst the increased borrowing 
requirement of the Government and heightened 
uncertainty in market conditions surrounding 
domestic debt restructuring concerns, the yields on government securities increased significantly during 2022, disproportionate to the adjustment in policy interest rates and other market interest rates.",Monetary Policy

1Moreover, while providing liquidity to banks through 
open market operations on need basis, measures 
were introduced in January 2023 to reduce the Licensed Commercial Banks’ (LCBs) over-reliance 
on the Central Bank’s standing facilities, thereby 
reducing asymmetries in the distribution of liquidity in 
the domestic money market.",Monetary Policy
"Consequently, overnight 
liquidity in the domestic money market and activity in 
the interbank call and repo markets improved.",Monetary Policy
"Along 
with improved rupee liquidity conditions and the 
improvement in investor sentiment in  anticipation 
of the successful finalisation of the IMF-EFF 
arrangement, a notable moderation in yields on 
government securities was observed towards the 
end of 2022 and early 2023.",Monetary Policy
"Other market interest 
rates also started to ease gradually from late 2022, 
correcting the disorderly upward adjustment in the 
market interest rates.",Monetary Policy
"However, given the necessity of 
fulfilling all the ‘prior actions’ in order to move forward 
with the finalisation of the IMF-EFF arrangement, and 
concerns raised by the IMF staff about the need to 
further tighten policy interest rates, the Central Bank and the IMF staff reached a consensus and raised 
policy interest rates by 100 basis points in early March 2023, compared to a larger upward adjustment 
proposed by the IMF during the finalisation of the staff level agreement in September 2022.",Monetary Policy
"With this 
policy action, the Central Bank communicated to the market the need to lower the spread between policy 
interest rates and high market interest rates, while underscoring the possible downward adjustment in 
risk premia, as more information becomes available on domestic restructuring perimeters.",Monetary Policy
"The market 
interest rate movements continued to decline, narrowing the spread between the policy interest 
rates and other market interest rates as anticipated.",Monetary Policy
"Meanwhile, the Government shared more information 
on the domestic debt optimisation perimeters in late 
March 2023, which led to a notable adjustment in the 
Treasury bill yields, subsequently.",Monetary Policy
"The growth of broad money supply (m
2b), 
which accelerated notably in early 2022, 
amidst the substantial expansion of credit to 
the public sector and the revaluation effects of 
foreign currency denominated domestic credit, 
decelerated thereafter, largely on account of the contraction of credit to the private sector.",Fiscal Policy
"By end 2022, the year-on-year growth of M
2b was 
recorded at 15.4 per cent, and once adjusted for the impact of the rupee depreciation,
1 the same is 
estimated to have decelerated to around 7 per cent  
by end 2022 from 13.2 per cent at end 2021.",Monetary Policy
"Although outstanding credit to the private sector by LCBs increased notably, in rupee terms, during 
early 2022 mainly on account of the revaluation 
effects of foreign currency denominated loans and 
advances amidst the substantial depreciation of the 
rupee, credit extended to the private sector by LCBs 
continued to contract from mid-2022 in response to 
the tight monetary conditions and the moderation 
in economic activity.",Monetary Policy

estimated contraction of 3.3 per cent, year-on-year,

strengthen fiscal consolidation efforts in the medium 
term, while minimising any potential negative impact on economic activity.",Fiscal Policy

the ongoing debt restructuring is expected to result in a notable reduction in the Government’s debt 
service burden and limit the annual gross financing needs to below 13 per cent of GDP, on average, 
during 2027-2032, as envisaged under the IMF-
EFF arrangement.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, foreign currency debt servicing of the central government is expected to be maintained below 4.5 per cent of GDP in any year

"With the 
completion of the proposed debt restructuring and 
implementation of broad-based economic reforms

decades.1.5 issues and Policies
From being one of the most promising 
nations in the developing world a few decades 
ago to one that is struggling to overcome multiple crises in the present day, successive governments have failed to steer the island nation towards sustained socio-economic progress and prosperity.",Fiscal Policy
"Despite the many 
initiatives taken since independence, the country has faced difficulties in thriving due to the lack of a robust and consistent national policy framework, resulting in poor macroeconomic performance, sustained twin deficits reflecting legacy issues and slow evolution, adaptability and transformation, thereby losing pace and falling behind peer economies, especially in the most recent decades.",Fiscal Policy
"Although the end of the three decades long internal conflict provided the country with the opportunity to make a new beginning, the lack of far-sighted policies and dearth of coherence in implementing corrective policy actions and reforms, alongside numerous social, 
political, and macroeconomic challenges have 
been impediments to the economy in reaching its 
potential.",Fiscal Policy
"To overcome many of these challenges 
and longstanding issues, policymakers and 
relevant authorities need to urgently embark 
on implementing several potentially painful yet essential reforms.",Fiscal Policy
"Most importantly, a crisis presents several opportunities to bring about change and implement reforms to address structural issues, i.e., an opportunity to ‘reset’ the economy.",Fiscal Policy
"While commending several measures that have been recently undertaken to address some of these lasting issues, it is necessary for the Government to remain committed to the structural reform agenda over the medium term and ensure that remaining actions are fulfilled and such actions in the near term are aligned with the medium term agenda, irrespective of political agendas.",Fiscal Policy
"39

1Sri lanka’s resolve and commitment to 
carrying out long overdue reforms would be 
a major factor in shaping the direction of the economy over the medium to long term.",Monetary Policy
"The IMF-EFF arrangement, amounting to approximately 
US dollars 3 billion, approved in March 2023, along with the envisaged support from other international 
financial institutions, is expected to provide the policy space needed for the economy to transition out of the unprecedented sovereign debt and BOP crises in the near term.",International Trade
"However, the non-recurrence of such crises in the future and the medium to long term sustainability of economic recovery would hinge on the successful implementation of the macroeconomic adjustment programme 
outlined under the IMF-EFF arrangement  that 
needs to be underpinned by strong political will 
and commitment.",Monetary Policy
"The integral elements of this macroeconomic adjustment programme include, (i) an ambitious fiscal consolidation led primarily by revenue, accompanied by reforms to social safety net, fiscal institutions and SOEs, aimed at restoring fiscal sustainability and strengthening fiscal discipline, (ii) a sovereign debt restructuring 
strategy aimed at restoring public debt  
sustainability, (iii) a multi-pronged strategy to restore 
price stability and rebuild international reserves amidst greater exchange rate flexibility, (iv) policies to safeguard financial stability, (v) focused reforms to address governance and corruption vulnerabilities,  
(vi) broader structural reforms to unlock Sri Lanka’s growth potential.",Fiscal Policy
"Despite having engaged in sixteen IMF programmes since 1965, Sri Lanka has an unsatisfactory track record on the completion of such programmes and the implementation of reforms, due to abrupt abandoning of the reform agenda.",Fiscal Policy
"This has resulted in a futile cycle of 
entry into such programmes during periods of 
economic hardship and premature exit with short-lived improvements in the economy.",Monetary Policy
"Against this backdrop, it is vital that policymakers show increased commitment and discipline in meeting the envisaged time-bound targets during each review 
under the present IMF-EFF arrangement, while 
garnering public support for necessary economic 
adjustments through improved awareness and 
transparent communication.",Monetary Policy
"This will not only 
give an opportunity to implement long neglected structural reforms but will also put the economy on 
a strong footing to transition to a sustainable growth 
path over the medium term, without having to go 
through extreme volatilities and painful adjustments 
frequently.",Fiscal Policy
"Successful implementation of the necessary structural reforms would circumvent the 
need to repeatedly approach the IMF for emergency 
funding and prevent the need for debt restructuring.",Fiscal Policy
"The rapid normalisation of economic conditions 
from the dire straits in the most part of 2022 is 
expected to facilitate the implementation of the 
aforementioned reforms.",Monetary Policy
"Notably, unlike previous 
IMF programmes, many painful reforms have been 
frontloaded in the current EFF arrangement; hence, it is expected that the continuation of such reforms 
will be relatively smoother, thereby enabling the 
economy to be more successful at completing the 
ongoing programme.",Fiscal Policy
"Going forward, Sri lanka needs to ensure 
effective prioritisation and utilisation of external 
financing to maintain external debt sustainability 
in the post-restructuring period.",Monetary Policy
"Sri Lanka had 
issued a total of US dollars 17.6 billion of ISBs 
from 2007 onwards and US dollars 17.2 billion of 
Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) from 2001 
onwards.",International Trade
"The proceeds of ISBs and SLDBs were 
primarily used for development purposes only in the 
early issuances, while the proceeds of most of the 
subsequent issuances were primarily used for budget support or for debt repayments and interest payments 
on such debt due to the significantly large budget 
deficits and mounting external debt that escalated

compelled further foreign currency borrowings from global markets at commercial rates.",Fiscal Policy
"Accordingly, it ""40

from reliance on highly commercial foreign currency 
debt towards equity based foreign financing, amidst 
envisaged improvements in international sovereign

"The 
foreign financing mix and strategy need to be carefully crafted by identifying purposes for which 
such funds are used with a view to improving the 
capacity to generate foreign exchange inflows.",Monetary Policy
"For 
instance, attracting foreign financing into strategically 
important projects, such as renewable energy, would be vital in addressing energy sector vulnerabilities 
without imposing excessive strains on the fiscal and 
external sectors.",Fiscal Policy
"Moreover, future attempts to resort 
to any form of debt financing need to be evaluated 
objectively against costs and benefits and the 
need for such financing in order to ensure that debt 
vulnerabilities do not arise in the future.",Fiscal Policy
"Successful implementation of the debt 
restructuring process, in line with the debt sustainability targets outlined under the  
imF-EFF arrangement, remains crucial prior 
to opening the country to global financial and 
capital markets.",Fiscal Policy
"Sri Lanka needs to finalise the 
debt restructuring process expeditiously in line with 
the debt sustainability targets set out under the  
IMF-EFF arrangement.",Fiscal Policy
"Plans are underway to publicly 
announce Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring strategy in 
the near term following the public announcement 
on the envisaged treatment of domestic debt in late 
March 2023, enabling commencement of the debt 
restructuring process at the earliest.",Fiscal Policy
"Finalisation 
of this process is anticipated before September 
2023.",Monetary Policy
"Even after successful debt restructuring, any 
improvement to international ratings will be a gradual process and will depend on the success of rebuilding 
the economy.",Monetary Policy
"International experience suggests 
that after debt restructuring, countries have taken 
considerable time to improve sovereign ratings and 
build up confidence prior to attracting foreign financing from bilateral and commercial creditors.",Monetary Policy
"Against this backdrop, the country must endeavour to move away 
from debt financing in the near to medium term and find ways to attract non debt creating funding sources, such as equity financing, primarily through foreign direct investment and public-private partnership arrangements.",Fiscal Policy
"long overdue structural reforms need to 
be carried out expeditiously to turn around lossmaking SOEs and eliminate the fiscal  
burden as well as the over-reliance on commercial banks, thereby containing the risks arising from these institutions that hinder the fiscal and macroeconomic, and financial stability.",Fiscal Policy
"Although SOEs perform key roles in numerous strategic economic sectors, such as electricity, petroleum, water, banking, 
transportation, and aviation, a significant share of 
these entities continues to grapple with an array 
of issues, including operational inefficiencies,  
poor governance and mismanagement, lack of accountability and transparency, weak market orientation, continuing political interference through high level appointments and excessive workforce.",Fiscal Policy
"These issues, in turn, have culminated in the weak financial performance of SOEs, thereby resulting in 
a multifaceted macroeconomic burden to the country 
through their adverse implications on state owned banks, and more recently on some private banks as well, draining of public finances via capital infusions, mounting contingent liabilities of the Government,  
and with no satisfactory quality of service to the general public.",Fiscal Policy
"For instance, credit to public corporations from the banking sector amounted to Rs. 1.7 trillion

Government was compelled to provide around  
Rs. 80 billion to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as equity during 2022 to ease its liquidity stresses.",Monetary Policy

allowing them to bypass Parliamentary oversight.",Fiscal Policy
"In addition, timely preparation of financial accounts of 
the large majority of SOEs and the disclosure of these 
statements are largely absent, thereby hindering transparency and public scrutiny.",Fiscal Policy
"Despite the identification of fraud, corruption, mismanagement, 
and negligence in certain SOEs, such issues have 
hardly been addressed promptly at respective Board 
levels or at the Parliamentary committee levels.",Fiscal Policy
"In addition, successive governments have used 
SOEs to implement populist policies.",Fiscal Policy
"For example, 
utilities and public sector services, including energy, 
petroleum, water, transportation, etc., have been 
provided to the general public at below cost recovery prices for a long time.",Fiscal Policy
"The costs of these untargeted subsidies were borne by the SOEs, resulting in large accumulated losses, which were mostly covered by transfers from the central government budget.",Fiscal Policy
Non-cost reflective prices have been the major reason for the bleak financial performance and poor market orientation of the major SOEs in the country.,Fiscal Policy
"All the aforementioned issues have disincentivised SOEs to operate as profitable commercial ventures, thereby imposing an undue burden on the Government, banks and the public.",Fiscal Policy
"When borrowings of SOEs were at unsustainably high levels, in the past, the Government has been compelled to step in to relieve such debt burden using its revenue collection.",Fiscal Policy
"As part of the actions agreed under the IMF-EFF arrangement, the outstanding foreign currency debt of Rs.",Fiscal Policy
"884.1 billion of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (US dollars 2,434.8 million) was absorbed into central government debt by end 2022.",Fiscal Policy
"In addition, the outstanding balance

dollars 1,427.3 million), obtained from China’s 
Export-Import (EXIM) Bank and recorded under 
Sri Lanka Ports Authority, CEB, and Airport and 
Aviation Services (Pvt) Ltd., were also absorbed into 
central government debt by end 2022.",Fiscal Policy
"Against this 
backdrop, institutional reforms are highly warranted in relation to SOEs to improve their efficiency, 
financial viability, and accountability.",Fiscal Policy
"Recognising the need to make SOEs financially viable, the  
IMF-EFF arrangement prescribed the introduction of cost reflective price revisions of several key utilities.",Fiscal Policy
"Such pricing mechanisms need to continue with enhanced transparency to ensure that the SOEs are not only generating increased revenues but are 
also striving to reduce costs, without passing on 
their inefficiencies by way of higher prices.",Fiscal Policy
"Further,  
non-strategic SOBEs should be considered 
for divestiture or listing in the CSE to reduce the fiscal burden of such entities and  
ensure improved institutional and commercial efficiency.",Fiscal Policy
The institutional transparency and accountability of remaining SOEs should be enhanced through mandatory and regular Parliamentary oversight.,Fiscal Policy
"The SOEs should be provided with binding institutional goals and targets that are linked to key performance indicators, for which the management of SOEs should be held accountable.",Fiscal Policy
"The perks and benefits received by the respective Boards, the management and employees 
of these SOEs should be linked to their performance 
and achievement of institutional goals.",Fiscal Policy
"Accordingly, 
it is vital that the Government remains committed 
to implementing the SOE reform agenda to ensure that such enterprises emerge as growth facilitators in the economy.",Fiscal Policy
"Moreover, as already identified by the Government, the energy sector will need drastic reforms through unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution subsectors to achieve operational efficiency in the electricity sector.",Fiscal Policy
"It is also necessary for SOEs, such as CEB, to review commercial contracts entered into with private power suppliers ensuring that undue benefits are not passed onto such companies at significant costs to CEB.",Fiscal Policy

technology to  further enhance government revenue mobilisation on a sustainable basis are essential.",Fiscal Policy
"The tax system in Sri Lanka has been plagued by inconsistent and  ad hoc policy changes that are 
targeted to serve as short term fixes, mainly in light of revenue shortfalls each year.",Fiscal Policy
The introduction of retrospective surcharge tax and frequently changing government policy on taxes on business turnover are examples of such inconsistent tax policies.,Fiscal Policy
"As a result, submitting tax returns and forecasting tax liabilities have become cumbersome for businesses and individuals, in turn discouraging taxpayers from maintaining voluntary tax compliance.",Fiscal Policy
"A weak tax 
administration system could serve to mobilise a 
high tax revenue from easy to tax sectors, whereas 
the need is to implement an equitable tax system, 
where the burden of taxes is distributed fairly 
among the population.",Fiscal Policy

in the country should be formulated considering 
the revenue requirements of the Government, 
development objectives of the country, equity of 
tax policies, and convenience for both the taxpayer 
and tax administrator.",Fiscal Policy
"Meanwhile, tax administration 
should be strengthened to minimise administration 
costs, tax avoidance, tax evasion, and various tax 
frauds.",Fiscal Policy
"While existing weaknesses in the Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMIS) that have resulted in substantial revenue losses to the Government need to be rectified expeditiously, new technologies should be introduced for tax revenue collection of both direct and indirect taxes.",Fiscal Policy
"For example, the introduction of a real time invoicing system will help prevent frauds related to value added and turnover taxes and provide opportunities to conduct tax audits 
efficiently.",Fiscal Policy
"In addition, linking databases of revenue 
collection agencies, financial institutions, and other property registration institutions would help reduce tax evasion, thereby expanding the taxpayer base.",Fiscal Policy
"The introduction of cutting edge technologies, such as blockchains, integrated customs management systems, cargo scanners, and trackers have helped many countries to minimise cross border tax evasion.",Fiscal Policy
"Sri Lanka has a large informal sector, which is hardly captured by the tax net, while many in the formal sector are also evading taxes due to cash transactions since revenue collecting agencies are unable to track income received through cash payments by individuals and businesses.",Fiscal Policy
"Therefore, revenue collection agencies will be able to track tax evaders as well as those who engage in benami  
transactions by promoting a ‘cashless economy’.",Fiscal Policy
"Meanwhile, the tax collection process is significantly burdened by the current appeal and grievance handling process, which is highly time consuming and 
prevents revenue collection agencies from achieving 
their revenue collection targets.",Fiscal Policy

a large number of unsettled cases in respect of tax 
avoidance, non-payment of taxes, and extended 
time periods given for tax evaders.",Fiscal Policy

of transparency, Inland Revenue Department (IRD) 
should publish the number of pending and settled 
tax cases on a periodic basis to enable the general 
public to understand efforts made by the IRD to

government revenue without significantly burdening 
its existing taxpayers.",Fiscal Policy

should be complemented with proper  
expenditure management strategies to ensure a sustained fiscal consolidation in the medium to long run.",Fiscal Policy
"Although tax reforms are imperative to improve government finances, such measures could even be counterproductive if 
not accompanied by efficient public expenditure 
reforms, as additional revenue from taxes could be allocated for inefficient public expenditure 
programmes due to lack of expenditure curtailment

"A large fraction of government expenditure in Sri Lanka remains rigid in nature with a significant share of expenses allocated for salaries and wages, pension and 
subsidies, and interest payments.",Fiscal Policy
"However, 
the implementation of appropriate expenditure management techniques can create leeway for expenditure curtailment.",Fiscal Policy
"In preparation of the 
annual budget of the Government, traditional 
budgeting techniques, such as the incremental budgeting process,

this budgeting process, especially by training the 
staff of spending agencies, who contribute to the 
preparation of government budgets.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, in lieu of imposing a blanket approach to the curtailment 
of expenditure of all spending agencies, measures 
should be implemented with due consideration to 
the priority of each economic activity within the

case-by-case assessment is required when implementing expenditure rationalisation in order 
to ensure that effective spending agencies receive 
the required resources, while inefficient ones

was further exacerbated by limited food imports 
amidst the dearth of foreign exchange liquidity.",Fiscal Policy
"Nevertheless, after being in force for six months, the fertiliser ban was revoked in identifying the need for the gradual phasing out of inorganic fertiliser use in agriculture.",Fiscal Policy
"Although policies on price controls could play a significant role in ensuring that food remains affordable and accessible to everyone, price controls implemented by the Government showed limited success in easing food price pressures in Sri Lanka amidst the food shortages in 2022, reflecting the lack of coordination among stakeholders and absence of resilient buffer stocks to avert price pressures as well as rising cost elements of food supply resulted from the economic crisis.",Fiscal Policy
"The government paddy purchasing programme, which was carried out during late 2022 to purchase paddy at higher prices to support the farmers, failed to deliver envisaged outcome due to the lack of funds with the Paddy Marketing Board.",Fiscal Policy
"Further, the ban on use of paddy or rice in animal feed production, which aimed at ensuring the high availability of rice for human consumption, had adverse consequences on the poultry sector with limited availability of imported animal feeds.",Fiscal Policy

Monetary Policy Review: No.",Monetary Policy
"0 1 - January  2024 
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka maintains policy interest rates at their 
current levels   
 
The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its meeting held on 2 2 January  
2024, decided to maintain  the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending 
Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of  9.00 per cent and 10.00 per 
cent, respectively.",Monetary Policy
"The Board arrived at this decision following a comprehensive assessment of 
domestic and international macro economic developments  in order  to maintain  inflation at  the 
targeted level of 5 per cent  over the medium term , while  enabl ing the economy to reach  its 
potential .",Inflation
"The Board took note of  the effects of  the recent developments in taxation and  
supply -side factors that are likely to pose upside pressures on inflation in the near term.",Inflation
"However,  
the Board viewed that the impact of these developments would not materially change the 
medium -term inflation outlook .",Inflation
"Further, the Board noted the space created by past monetary 
policy easing measures  and the decline in the risk premia attached to  government securities for 
further downward adjustment in market lending interest rates.",Monetary Policy
"The Board underscored that the 
envisaged benefit of further reduction in market lending interest rates need s to be adequately 
and swiftly passed on to the businesses and individuals by financial institutions.",Monetary Policy
"Inflation is expected to stabilise at the desired levels as the effects of the recent tax 
adjustment s and supply  side disruptions  are expected to dissipate in the near term  
Headline inflation, as measured by the year -on-year change in the Colombo Consumer Price 
Index (CCPI, 2021=100) , was recorded at 4.0 per cent in Decem ber 2023 , compared to  3.4 per 
cent in Novem ber 2023.",Inflation
"Following five consecutive months of deflation, the food category 
recorded inflation (year-on-year) in December 2023  reflecting mainly the weather -related 
disruptions , while non -food inflation (year -on-year) moderated  compared to the previous month.",Inflation
"Despite the recent acceleration, h eadline inflation  remains closer to the inflation target of the 
Central Bank and is in line with the envisaged inflation projections  of the Central Bank .",Inflation
"Meanwhile, 
core inflation (year -on-year) continued to moderat e in Decem ber 2023, compared to the previous 
month, reflecting the subdued demand pressures in the economy.",Inflation
"Headline inflation is projected  
to record an upward movement in the near term , as expected , driven mainly  by domestic price

"2 
 adjustments due to the increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) and the elimination of certain VAT 
exemptions effective 01 January 2024 , disruptions to the domestic food supply,  and the dissipation 
of the favourable statistical base effect.",Fiscal Policy
"However, this acceleration of inflation  in the near term  is 
expected to be short -lived, and the spillover effects of such one -off adjustment s are likely to be 
muted due to subdued underlying demand conditions.",Inflation
"Therefore, o ver the medium term, headline 
inflation is expected  to gradually stabilise around the targeted level of 5 per cent (year -on-year), 
supported by appropriate policy measures.",Inflation
"They are conditional 
on the forecasts of global energy and food prices; gradual growth recovery of Sri Lanka’s major trading partners; the anticip ated domestic 
fiscal path in line with the IMF -EFF proj ections under the debt restructuring scenario  and global financial conditions implied by the 
monetary policy stance of the USA.",Monetary Policy
"Further, the projections are conditional on the model -consistent interest rate path and the resulting 
macroeconomic responses.",Monetary Policy
"A ny notable change in these assumptions could lead to the realised inflation path deviating from the 
projected path.",Inflation
"In particular, there are upside risks to inflation projections stemming from factors such as the possibility of mo re than anticipated second -round impacts of increased taxation; possible wage hikes; the impact of possible adverse weather on agricultural production and in turn on food inflation; the uncertainty over global oil, energy and food prices, particularly amid st volatile geopolitical tensions, etc.",Inflation
"Meanwhile, downside risks to inflation projections include the possibility of price reductions in domestically manufactured items amidst  increased 
competition from imports and the sustained impact of diminished purch asing power of the public.",Inflation
"The Central Bank remains committed to communicating any changes to the inflation outlook to the public on a regular basis, enabling 
the public to make informed decisions.",Inflation

"Meanwhile, reflecting the transmission of the relaxed monetary policy stance , outstanding credit to the private sector by the banking sector continued to expand notably on a month -on-month basis in Novem ber as well as December  2023.",Monetary Policy

expected to be sustained in the period ahead, supported by the further easing of monetary 
conditions .",Monetary Policy
"Domestic economic activity is expected to sustain the recovery over the medium term  
The Sri Lankan economy recorded an expansion in the third quarter of  2023 , following six 
consecutive quarters of economic contraction.",GDP Growth

grown  by 1.6 per cent, year -on-year, in the third quarter of  2023 , as per the GDP estimates 
published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) .",GDP Growth
"This was a broad -based expansion 
in economic activity s upported by expansions recorded in Agriculture , Industry and Services 
sectors, on a year -on-year basis.",GDP Growth
"The rebound in domestic economic activity is expected  to be 
sustained , supported by the faster passthrough of relaxed monetary policy to broader market 
interest rates  and the resultant firming of credit demand,  improvements in business and investor 
sentiments, improvements in supply conditions  and the gradual rebound expected in external 
demand conditions .",Monetary Policy
"The external sector is expected to remain resilient in the period ahead  
The merchandise trade deficit is estimated to have moderated during  2023 in comparison to 
2022 .",International Trade

and the strong momentum of workers’ remittances , is expected to have resulted in a surplus in 
the current account balance of the ba lance of payment s for 2023.",International Trade
"Gross official reserves  (GOR)  improved notably to US dollars 4.4 billion by end December 2023 , which include the swap facility from the People’s Bank of China  (PBOC) .",Exchange Rates
